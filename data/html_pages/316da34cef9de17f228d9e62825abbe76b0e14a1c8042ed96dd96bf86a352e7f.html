This web site allows you to prepare and submit an application to
MIT EECS for Graduate Admissions.



<p>
<center><b>Hello Potential Applicant to the EECS PhD Program!</b></center>
<p>
We want to welcome you as you consider applying to the doctoral program in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology! Graduate school at MIT will prepare you to become a field leader, will invite you to work on innovative teams, and ultimately, you will contribute to advancing knowledge.
<p>
We are dedicated to purposefully fostering practices of inclusive excellence, to celebrating uniqueness, and we strive to provide our students an experience where they thrive academically and professionally, and enjoy being their best selves.  Each member of our department is valued, and we are delighted that you are considering becoming a part of our EECS and MIT communities.   
<p>
Below, please add these important <i><b>virtual</b></i> event dates into your calendar; the event goal is to provide more information about graduate school in EECS at MIT. The chair of EECS graduate admissions will host the discussions, and will offer an overview of the EECS department and the graduate admission process. Together with some EECS PhD alumni, you will hear (i) if the PhD journey is worthwhile, (ii) advice about what they might have done differently, and (iii) what opportunities become possible with a PhD degree. 
<ul>
	<li> The Nov. 12 Webinar discussion "Was the PhD Worth it?" was recorded live and can be viewed here: <a href=https://youtu.be/br6in-H6GpI target="_blank" >https://youtu.be/br6in-H6GpI</a> The video will be available to watch until December 2nd, when the 2025 applications website closes.
</ul>

We invite you to view a YouTube video featuring EECS at MIT faculty and staff (who are on the graduate admission committee) discuss the evaluation of applications to the EECS PhD program. The admission committee members offer insightful guidance on the preparation of doctoral graduate applications (for submission to MIT or to any graduate program). 
Here is the YouTube link: <a href=https://youtu.be/OeLGNNPZYZs target=_blank>https://youtu.be/OeLGNNPZYZs</a>.  In a second YouTube video, found here <a href=https://youtu.be/yMwR_gI8v0w target=_blank>https://youtu.be/yMwR_gI8v0w</a>, we invite you to hear from current MIT EECS PhD students discussing life as a graduate student.  They offer great nuggets of wisdom and advice about navigating the PhD journey.
