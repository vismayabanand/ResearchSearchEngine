<b>Recipients of <i>The Coach Award</i>,  School of Computer Science</b><br>
&ndash; The Master of Software Engineering Programs celebrated
it's 15th anniversary in the Fall 2005: a remarkable
achievement in that over 15 generations (~350 students) of 
highly trained, disciplined software professionals from 
industry, government and academia had already passed through their
environment and were now strategically placed throughout
these organizations &ndash; globally.  What started as a vision to build
a formal degree program for software engineering has become a commonly
accepted, continually evolving and dynamically expanding
<i>science</i> of software engineering.  <p>

In tribute to that anniversary, and in recognition of
the contributions made to the discipline by the professors,
lecturers, students, mentors, clients and sponsors that
enabled the software engineering discipline and the related
academic programs to grow and thrive, the MSE
established a series of awards/recognitions under
the rubric <i>The Coach Awards</i>. The term <i>Coach</i> has deep cultural roots in our environment.
But first and foremost, it pays tribute to a man who
dedicated his life - beginning in the early 1980's - to the development
of an educational program in software engineering: James E. Tomayko.
