<P><b>My newest favorite quote:</b>

<hr>
<P><b>Previous favorite quotes:</b>

<P><b>Favorite 2017 quote about Trump:</b>
<BR>David Gergen, moderate Republican comentator, said that Donald Trump may have had 
the worst first 100 days of any President.
<BR>One of the other commentators pointed out that William Henry Harrison 
<b>died</b> in his first 100 days, so it's <b>not clear</b> which one was worse.
<P><B>Best Trump joke so far (2016):</B>
<BR>Trump's secret plan to destroy ISIS: He's going to buy it, and run
it like one of his casinos.

<P><B>On a serious note: (December 2016)</B>
<BR>It bothers me that people seem to think "the polls were all
wrong".
<BR>The polls predicted a very close race, and they have margins of
error.
<BR>In particular, <a href="nate-silver-was-right.html">Nate Silver at
  538 was actually right</a>, contrary to many people's opinions.

<P><B>Recycling an old joke:</B>
<BR>I believe Donald Trump will make this country what it once was: a barren wasteland, covered in ice.

<P><B>My attitude about the 2016 US Presidential election:</B>
<BR>In October I went from being terrified to just disappointed.
<BR>November edit: I guess I should have stayed terrified.
<BR><B>2021 edit:</B>Whew.  Glad that's over.  Hope it doesn't come back.

<P>April 2015: 
<BR>A Republican political operative said something wonderful:
<BR><B>Hillary Clinton could beat Donald Trump from jail.</B>
<BR>This contains several important points in one short sentence. And
it's still funny, in a bitter-sweet way.

<p>At the 7/4/2012 CERN news conference announcing the Higgs boson, a reporter
asked how they could justify spending all this money on something so arcane,
with Europe in a financial crisis, people starving in the third world, etc.
<br>Prof. Rolf Heuer, Director General of CERN, replied with a wonderful
illustration of how you have to get the right balance between basic
science and other spending:
<br>
<b>If you have one sack of corn, do you eat it or do you plant it?
<br>In both cases you are going to starve, to die.
<br>You have to find the balance: part of it you eat, and part of it you plant.
</b>

<P><B>She's my arch-enemy.  The Dr. Doom to my Mister Fantastic; 
the Dr. Octopus to
my Spiderman; the Dr. Sivana to my Captain Marvel.  
<BR>It's amazing how
many super-villains have advanced degrees. 
<BR>Graduate schools should
probably do a better job screening those people out.</B>

<BR>(BBT used to be my favorite TV show, because it got nerd culture
exactly right.  I know these people; in my 20s, I <B>was</B> Leonard,
but not short.)(Near the end it turned into mostly a standard rom-com.)


<p><b>My children's school was canceled today. Because of what? Some ice?... 
We're going to have to apply some flinty Chicago toughness to this
town.</b>
<BR>-- Barack Obama, 28 January 2009
<BR>I like this so much because I'm originally from Cleveland, and a
major complaint I have in winter is that Pittsburghers are terrified
of driving in what I think of as "a little snow".  Obama 
experienced the same kind of culture shock moving to D.C.

<P>During the 2014 US elections, I started writing down a
  few short essays on <A HREF=econ101.html>Honest Political Economics 101</A>, perhaps to beg the universe for
  just a little reason in political discussions about the economy.

<b>JGC60:</b> I was the General Chair for the April 2014

<br>It seems to have gone well.

<P>
<b>EAMT/SUSU MT School:</b> I was one of the instructors at <A href=http://www.lanaconsult.com/mtschool-susu/>The Joint EAMT - SUSU
Intensive School in Machine Translation</A>, in Chelyabinsk, Russia,
May 16-20, 2011.
<br>While there, I got my wife a lovely 
<A HREF="stone-heart.jpg">malachite heart</A> at the Ural Mountains mineral museum we toured.

<p>
<font color=red><b>2013 update:</b></font> Yes, I spent a week in <b>Chelyabinsk,
  Russia</b>, where that meteor exploded in February!
<br>We had a lovely cruise on the lake where divers have been looking
for meteor remains.  
<br>Meteors almost never cause damage, and that's the only place I've
spent significant time in in Russia,
<br>so I'm pretty stunned.

<p><b>SMT without the S:</b> As part of preparing for the MT school above, I made 
<A HREF=SMTwoS.ppt>these powerpoint slides</A>, which explain to
people who might not know any statistics or computer programming how
Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) works.  
<BR>Since <b>Neural MT/Deep Learning MT</b> is just another kind of SMT,
these work for that too.
<br>They are based on the idea
of fitting a line to data points, which everyone has some familiarity with.
<br>The suggested story to tell along with them is in the "Notes"
section of the slides.
<br>I hereby declare them freely available "open source" slides.
If you use them, please mention where you got them.  Thanks.

<P>I co-taught the graduate <A HREF="sel/">Seminar on Endangered Languages</A>, 11-736, Fall 2010.
<BR>We taught
<A HREF=http://www.lti.cs.cmu.edu/Courses/fall11-course-desc.htm>it
  again</A> in Fall each year so far.
<BR>We skipped F18, and will probably offer it every other year now.

<p><b>Haitian Creole data:</b> After the January 2010 Haiti
  earthquake, we released 
<A HREF=http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/haitian/>
the Haitian Creole data</A> that I had been preserving since the end of
  the <A HREF="#DIPLOMAT">Diplomat project</A>, to facilitate public speech and translation work on

<P><b>Public Notice:</b> It took some web detective work, but I
  determined that the alleged nonpartisan 
<A HREF="http://www.thepublicnotice.org/">
Public Notice</A> that runs
<A HREF="http://www.bankruptingamerica.org/">
  Bankrupting America</A> is (of course) run by 
<A HREF="http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/morning-fix/-1-2-3-9.html">
a Republican, Gretchen
  Hamel</A>, who is rightfully ashamed to admit clearly on the website that 
<A HREF="http://www.thepublicnotice.org/about/staff/">
she worked in
  the George W. Bush administration</A>.  Their hiring notices mention that
  you have to have a compatible political philosophy to work there,
  which I guess means being a Republican willing to 
<A HREF="http://politics.usnews.com/opinion/articles/2010/02/25/pay-go-budget-rules-do-little-to-control-spending-or-reduce-deficit.html">
lie and say you're
  non-partisan</A>.
  Too bad she didn't care about deficits when she worked for Bush, who
  ran up giant deficits in times of relative prosperity.
<BR>(For the record, all really independent analysts agree that the
stimulus really did save millions of jobs.  The most obvious example: the state workers
who would have been laid off if the states hadn't gotten their
stimulus money.  Deficit spending is necessary during a Great
Recession to avoid a real Depression; but the budget should balance before and after!)

<BR>I <a href=IMG_7803-smaller.JPG>learned to surf</a> while there.

<BR>I also visited the <a href=Kilauea.JPG>active Kilauea volcano</a> on the Big Island.
<a href=Kilauea.JPG>This view</a> is facing south; the nearby rim is the rim of Kilauea
Caldera, the fully visible crater inside is Halema'uma'u Crater, with the
volcanic gas coming out of one particular spot in its floor.  The
white deposits are sulfur.
Half of the national park was closed due to the
<a href=KilaueaWarning1.jpg>high levels of volcanic gas</a>,
which is kind of exciting.

<P>I've begun a personal project of digitizing my VHS tapes, cassette
tapes, and vinyl(!) LPs, while it's still possible.  
<br>(VHS via my TiVo
[Humax version, with a DVD burner in it], audio via my Mac and Audacity.)
<br>It takes enough of my precious time that it's only worth doing for things that
will never make it into digital on their own, like 
<a href="http://www.curvedair.com/1973.htm">"Metamorphosis"</a>,
a wonderful track over 10 minutes long from Curved Air (but maybe the only good thing they
ever did; sorry).
There's a 
<a href="http://www.gaudela.net/air/samples.html">low-fi clip</a>
of the beginning of "Metamorphosis" on the web now (June 2008). 
<br>Time-wise, if I can buy it on CD/DVD, that's actually worth it.

<br>Flynn had hoped for fame and fortune from the YouTube.Com video of
him talking, below.
<BR>Below that we have a video of

<br><b>2010 Update:</b> We also have a YouTube video of Flynn driving,

<br><b>2015 Update:</b> Flynn passed away on March 20, 2015, after a
short illness.  
<BR>On Labor Day we acquired a new puppy, 
<A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ref/Toby.jpg">Toby</A>, also a Westie (we're
hooked on Westies).
<BR>As of late September 2015, we were waiting for Vince to decide it's really a dog.
<BR>Vince eventually believed Toby was a dog, but remained a bit jealous.
<br><b>March 2018 Update:</b> Vince passed away on March 2, 2018, after a
short illness.  Toby is an only dog, for now.
<br><b>September 2018 Update:</b> We acquired a new Westie puppy, Gus,
from the same farm that Toby came from.
Here is Gus <A HREF="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ref/pgss/GusAndToby.jpeg">playing with a full-grown Toby</A>.
<br><b>March 2019 Update:</b> See the "3 Westies chasing" video below: 
Gus is the one carrying the toy; Toby is the other one in a red

Star Wars.  The meeting to discuss forming a Pittsburgh chapter
took place in Jim Morris's house (I believe he was head of the ITC at
the time).  A friend of mine from grad school here,

<li> <img src="wahoo.gif"> I waited my whole life for <a
href="http://www.indians.com/">the
Cleveland Indians</a> to make the World Series.  They finally did in <a
href="letterman-on-indians.html">
1995</a>, and again in 1997.  
<br> It was especially poignant that we beat the Orioles in 1997, since Baltimore
stole our football team (now the so-called Ravens).
In 1998 they gave the NY Yankees a
harder time in the playoffs than they had in the World Series.
I won't discuss the 1999 playoffs.
<BR>In 2007, we didn't make it to the World Series, but
it was especially lovely eliminating the NY
Yankees in the division playoffs.  <b>And</b> we got their manager fired!
<BR>We'll win it next time.
<BR>(BTW, I am a <a href="http://www.cleveland.com/">
Clevelander</a> living in <a href="http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/">Pittsburgh</a>.)  
<br><strong>Go Tribe!!! </strong> 
<br>The Indians played in Pittsburgh for the first time ever (I
believe) 1-3 September 1997.  I called in February for tickets, and
9/1 was sold out except for the bleachers!  I got tickets for 9/2,
though.  It seems that all of Cleveland goes to the games in Detroit,
and now Pittsburgh too.  Naturally, the game I was at was the only one
the Indians lost.  It was a good game, though.

It was fascinating, but you need

<br>I visited the world's largest radio dish at
<A HREF="arecibo.html">Arecibo Observatory</A> in Puerto Rico (March 2000).
  (2020 update: RIP Arecibo, I miss you already.)
<BR>Coolest trip so far: the total solar eclipse on 
<A HREF="africa2001.html">
21 June 2001 <strong>in tropical Africa</strong></A>.
<BR>A close second: my  <A HREF="dolphins04.html">10 days in the
Bahamas</A> as part of our  collaboration with the
<A HREF="http://www.wilddolphinproject.com/">Wild Dolphin Project</A>.
<BR>I also went to <A
HREF="#hi">Hawaii (see astronomy, above)</A> in 1991 for a total eclipse.  
I got to swim with <A
HREF="http://www.hitrade.com/Jour_PhDolphin1_0.html">
wild dolphins</A> there!
<BR>(In between Hawaii and southern Africa, I saw the
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_May_10,_1994>
1994 annular eclipse</A> that went through
Meadville, PA, on my mother's birthday!)
<BR>My third total eclipse: <A HREF="libya2006.html">29 March 2006,
in North Africa and Turkey</A>. 
<BR>My fourth eclipse: <A HREF="http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEmono/TSE2009/TSE2009iau/TSE2009-fig04.GIF">22 July 2009, Shanghai</A>.This was the first one I didn't see due to
overcast.  It was still pretty cool, because the sky got dark as night
on a drizzly gray morning.  I could tell everyone around me was saying "holy
crap", even though I don't know Mandarin.
<BR>My fifth eclipse: in the good old 
<A HREF=eclipse2017-photos.html>US of A in August 2017!</A>
<BR>My sixth eclipse: also in the 
<A HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_April_8,_2024>
US of A, in April 2024.</A>  It was cloudy enough where I was (NY) to not get
good photos.  Still impressive, though.
<BR>Already starting to think about
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_12,_2026>
Spain in 2026</A>, 
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_eclipse_of_August_2,_2027>

<LI> I'm so old, I had to register for <A HREF="sss.html">the
Vietnam draft</A>, in 1973.  That was the first year they didn't draft
anyone.  Whew.  I was beginning to think about becoming Canadian.
<BR>I also had a nice, high <A HREF=https://www.sss.gov/Portals/0/PDFs/1975.pdf>draft lottery number</A>: 248.  So I was "1 H"
("we're not going to bother classifying you").
<BR><b>2012 update:</b> I finally found <A HREF=Draft-card.jpg>my
  draft card</A>!  I was sure I had it
  stashed away somewhere.  
<BR> By the way, contrary to claims by those who are trying to rewrite history,
nobody I knew was crappy to the vets when they came back.  We generally felt
bad for them, that they had been screwed by the government.

<P><A NAME=Frederking>
<LI> There are fewer than 200 ``Frederking'' households in the United States,
and not very many in Germany, either.  I have an online <a
href="english.ps">PostScript family tree</a> that goes back to the 1620s.  It was
published in Germany in 1909.  I translated it from German into
English.  There's also now a <a
href="english">plain text version</a>.

<br>My ancestors, by the index of the tree:
<pre>
I 2, II 5, III 8, IV 2, V 4, VI 12, VII 8, VIII 11, IX 14 (grandpa; I would be generation XI)
</pre>
So I know the name of my 8th great grandfather, Eberhard.
<br>Before "we" got into the preaching business, "we" were cloth
merchants, it seems.
<br>Among many other interesting things, the brother of my ancestor,
Henrich (V 7), fought in the American Revolution... as a <A HREF="hessian.txt">Hessian mercenary</A>, for
the British!  
<BR>He was captured by George Washington at the Battle of Trenton.
<BR><A HREF="publiccs/REF-w-Hessians.jpeg"><IMG SRC="publiccs/REF-w-Hessians-cropped.jpeg" width=227></A>
<b>2019 update:</b> I finally visited the annual reenactment, and 
<A HREF="publiccs/REF-w-Hessians.jpeg">hung out with the Good Guys</A>.

<p>Cousin Konrad (V 2) was also a Hessian soldier.  He
went to India to fight for the British East India Company, and he died in Madras.
<br>The older brother of a later ancestor, August (VII 5), was killed in the
U.S. Civil War in Tennessee.  
<br>He is probably one of the "unknown" graves in the 
<A HREF=NashvilleNatlCem.jpg>Nashville National Cemetery</A>.
I visited it when I was there for 
<A HREF=eclipse2017-photos.html>2017 total solar eclipse</A>.
<BR>Before that he was in the
Mexican War, and then in California with the U.S. Army subduing the
natives, I'm sorry to say.

<p>I bought a <a href=namenkunde.txt>reference book</a> a few years ago in Germany, and was
stunned to see "Frederking" used as an example of the distribution of
a German family name: 
<a href=FrederkingNameMap.jpg>here is the map</A>.
<br>In the map, the kink in the river Weser is about where Minden is, and the
family tree shows that my family was in Minden for a long time.  It
also says that this area of Germany is the only one where the local
dialect would produce the name (which means "little Frederick", or son
of Frederick).
<br>According to <a href="dudendt25.txt">
another reference work</a> that I got in Germany,
the town name "Minden" probably comes from a watersprite named "Mime",
that perhaps was thought to live in the river there.
<br>My dad looked around the web for photos of Frederkings.  Genetics
can be spooky; <A HREF="danny.jpg">here's someone</A> who looks a lot like me (when I was 17).

<!--  See also stamm.txt and vonBuelow.txt  -->
<P><LI>Another branch of my ancestry comes from the von B&uuml;low family,
  which is north German aristocracy.  
<BR>This connects me to a bunch of famous people, including one of the chancellors of Germany.
<BR>Maybe for Americans, the most interesting distant relative is the
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manfred_von_Richthofen>Red
Baron</A> (Snoopy's nemesis, but the real guy).  His 14th great grandfather was my 15th
great grandfather.  So I believe my father was his 15th cousin.
<BR>Side note: it seems that
<A HREF=https://ideas.4brad.com/everybody-your-16th-cousin>almost
  everyone in Europe is my 15th cousin</A>.  But in this particular case,
  I know the actual people through the entire chain. 

<P>The most regal current distant relative that I know of is 
<A HREF=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem-Alexander>
King William (Willem-Alexander) of Holland</A>.  
<BR>He is my fifth cousin!  
<BR>(Through my ancestors Victor Frederking, Dorothea
Storm Frederking, Marie Brauer Storm, Helene Passow Brauer, and Luise
Sophie Ida von B&uuml;low Passow.  Luise was the sister of Auguste von
B&uuml;low, the ancestor of the king, via the von Amsberg and von
Passow families.)
<br>His dad
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Claus_of_the_Netherlands>Claus</A> looked a lot like my grandmother.
<BR>(Thanks to
<a HREF=http://www.adventlutheran.org/2018/06/fare-thee-well/>Rev. Dr. John Fiene</a>, another descendant of Brauers, for
tracking down <i>which</i> von B&uuml;low we came from.)
<BR>The von B&uuml;lows go way way back; my 19th von B&uuml;low 
great-grandfather was the 
<A HREF=https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%BClow_(Adelsgeschlecht)>
German knight Gottfried</A>, born before 1229!
<BR>My 14th-great-grandfather Claus was a brother and presumed henchman of
<A HREF=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heinrich_von_B%C3%BClow_%28Grotekop%29>
this guy</A>.  (There seem to be a lot of Clauses in the family.)
<BR>See also the <b>2024 update</b> below!

<P><b>2021 update:</b>
  Since they are a huge Prussian aristocratic family, the von
  B&uuml;lows
  have a huge Familienbuch (Family book) going back centuries.  I
  resumed reading 
about my ancient ancestors in there, and discovered that my
7th-great-grandfather Christian Friedrich v.B. was an officer in the
Danish cavalry, and fought in Ireland in the Battle of the Boyne in 1690!
This was where English King William of Orange defeated the Jacobites.
Translation: Protestants beat Catholics.  A pivotal moment in Irish, English,
and Scottish history.
<BR>Finding the Battle of the Boyne connection was through some additional
sleuthing. The family book just says that C.F.v.B. was an
Oberstleutenant (Lt. Col.) in the Danish army, and served in
Ireland. This seemed very odd to me, so I googled Danish army in Ireland, and
it turns out they played an important role in the Battle of the Boyne.
So I read a couple of history books on the subject.
It turns out that lots of the "Danish" officers were from small German states,
like Mecklenburg, where this guy lived.
<BR><B>2022 update:</B> The Danish national archives has records
showing that he was indeed a cavalry officer in one of the regiments
that fought in the Battle of the Boyne!

<P><b>2024 update:</b>
  We visited 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerin>Schwerin</a>, the capital of the former Duchy of 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mecklenburg>Mecklenburg</a>, in 2023,
  and wow.  The von B&uuml;lows were even bigger big-shots here than I
  had realized.  My 14th-great-grandfather Sir Claus (see above) and
  his brothers were knights.  But 3 of his great-uncles and a 
  first-cousin-once-removed were 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diocese_and_prince-bishopric_of_Schwerin>
Bishops of Mecklenburg</a> in the 1300s!  I need to read up
  on the medieval history of Mecklenburg.  At some point, the bishops
  were running the whole Duchy.  And 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_King_of_Sweden>
Duke Albert</a> (who the brothers
  worked for) was 
<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert,_King_of_Sweden>
King of Sweden</a>!  I clearly need to sort out these details.
<BR>In fact, in
  <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schwerin_Cathedral>Schwerin
  Cathedral</a>, there are two giant (life size) carved bronze plaques of my four
  bishop relatives.  Pretty impressive:

<LI>I also used Ancestry.com to track down <A HREF=UStree.txt>all my
  ancestors in the US</A>,
  back to the point of immigration.  The first one entered the US in 1837.

<P><A NAME=haplogroup>
<LI> Related to the above, at the end of 2006 I submitted a Y-DNA sample
for <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup">
haplotyping</A> to <A HREF="https://www3.nationalgeographic.com/genographic/">
the Genographic Project</A>.  The short version of the story is that
because only men have Y-DNA, it doesn't get shuffled around each
generation, but is generally passed on unchanged from father to son.  So you can
track the spread of humanity in the distant past by the accumulation
of small harmless mutations.
<BR>It turns out that my Y-DNA shows that I am a member of
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_I_%28Y-DNA%29">
Haplogroup I</A>.  So probably most/all other "Frederking"s from
Minden share this haplogroup (unless there was an adoption or some
other "irregularity" along the way).
<BR>Specifically, we are I2b-M223 (formerly I1c).
<BR>Some members of "Haplogroup I" were probably descended from the Vikings.
Although I'd like to claim Viking ancestry, most likely my branch is
the one centered near Minden, Germany, the ancestral Frederking
homeland, according to
<A HREF="http://www.relativegenetics.com/genomics/images/haploMaps/originals/I1c_large_RG.jpg">
this map</A>.  But we do have a cool story: group I is descended from
a small group of people who survived the last Ice Age in a valley somewhere in Europe, as opposed
to most Europeans who showed up after the Ice Age ended (those wimps!)
<BR>Of course, most of my 27,000 genes come from the millions of other
ancestors I have, but it is still interesting to know that one of them really
did hunker down in Europe during the Ice Age.
<BR>My sister submitted an <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mitochondrial_DNA_haplogroup">
mtDNA</A> sample; mtDNA is only passed on through the egg, so it is similarly
passed unshuffled down the female line.  The result: we are in 
<A href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haplogroup_U_%28mtDNA%29">
mtDNA
haplotype U1b</A>.  Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a specific
story about this haplotype yet, but they say they're still working on
these, so maybe it will get more interesting later.
<br>It does lend credence to the belief that we have some Jewish
ancestry in my family, though.
<br>Oh, and my blood type is <b>A+</b>.

<LI> To quote my resume: My current interests include most aspects of
natural language processing, as well as problems in knowledge
representation, reasoning, and system design, from both application
and theoretical viewpoints.  I am especially interested in problems of
the interaction between sentence understanding, sentence generation,
dialogue phenomena, and non-linguistic capabilities.  This includes
problems such as the interaction between NL and graphics, the
acquisition of semantic primitives via non-symbolic processes, and how
to represent and reason about continuous substances and time.  I am
also interested in the simulation of human cognition, and the
philosophical and theoretical foundations of artificial intelligence
and natural language.
