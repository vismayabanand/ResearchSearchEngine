<p>There is no doubt that a global pandemic is a scary phenomenon.&#160; Hence, it is not surprising that many stories regarding the event will surface and be communicated.&#160; For COVID-19 a number of stories containing inaccurate or misleading information have populated social media.&#160; We list here the stories of this type that have been identified.&#160; Whether they are being spread by those knowing they are inaccurate maliciously, as a joke, or simply to discuss the inaccuracy is under study at this time.&#160; The point here is simply that these stories are not accurate.</p>
<p>It is important to note that in every disaster or crisis situation disinformation and misinformation appear. It is also the case that many of these stories are short lived and have little impact.&#160; Further, many of these stories can be stopped simply by people calling them out, or making fun of them with satire.&#160; In many cases the spread of the stories can increase if they are rebroadcast by celebrities or news agencies.&#160; The irony is that in many cases, readers cannot tell when satire is being used, and may mistake the satire for fact.&#160; Another irony is that stories that talk about a story containing disinformation may spread both the inaccurate information and the information that it is inaccurate.</p>

<p><em>Compiled by Kathleen M. Carley with the help of the international SIMSOC team</em></p>
<p>&#160; The following are very simple simulations that help you understand how epidemics spread, and show the impact of interventions such as hand washing.&#160; These are instructional. There are also much more elaborate and accurate models that are used.&#160; Those more sophisticated models are not listed here. These are in no particular order within category.</p>
<ul>
<li>Simple contagion model in ORA that the user can run on any network of their choice &#8211; see <a href="http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/">http://www.casos.cs.cmu.edu/projects/ora/</a></li>
<li>ABM model: netlogo model already built:
<ul>
<li>Students can run the model after checking clearly written information. One issue is that you cannot run the model online. You first have to download netlogo, <a href="https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/epiDEMBasic" style="font-size: 1em;">https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/models/epiDEMBasic</a><span style="font-size: 1em;">.</span></li>
<li>AnyLogic SIR models (they have an ABM and SDM comparison that can be thought provoking). They're example models that come with the free student version of the software and there are also cloud versions as well I believe.</li>
<li>ABM models: Model Library that comes with NetLogo contains two models of disease spread in the Biology section.&#160; Also, in the Curricular Models section, there are two models that explore different ways of controlling the spread of an epidemic.</li>
<li>ABM model: showing impact of hand washing:&#160;<a href="http://research.criticalconnections.com.au/ABMBook/">http://research.criticalconnections.com.au/ABMBook/</a>&#160;but it's pretty buried within the 'teaching NetLogo' material&#160; This model is available from Jen Badham (lists@criticalconnections.com.au).</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Model showing impact of social distancing And this link discusses results of modeling effects of social distancing etc. to inform public health policy,&#160;<a href="https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf">https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-NPI-modelling-16-03-2020.pdf</a>&#160;</li>

<li>Simplistic simulator letting you examine nterventions by country based on hospital data and demographic data. It has several parameters and uses Chinese data to estimate severity assumptions.
