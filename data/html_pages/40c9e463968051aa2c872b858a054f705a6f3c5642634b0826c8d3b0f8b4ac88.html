Traditional machine learning texts focus on how to train and evaluate the machine learning model, while MLOps books focus on how to streamline model development and deployment. But neither focus on how to build actual products that deliver value to users. This practical textbook, by contrast, details how to responsibly build products with machine learning components, covering the entire development lifecycle from requirements and design to quality assurance and operations. Machine Learning in Production brings an engineering mindset to the challenge of building systems that are usable, reliable, scalable, and safe within the context of real-world conditions of uncertainty, incomplete information, and resource constraints. Based on the author's popular class at Carnegie Mellon, this pioneering book integrates foundational knowledge in software engineering and machine learning to provide the holistic view needed to create not only prototype models but production-ready systems.
• Integrates coverage of cutting-edge research, existing tools, and real-world applications
• Provides students and professionals with an engineering view for production-ready machine learning systems
• Proven in the classroom
• Offers supplemental resources including slides, videos, exams, and further readings</p></blockquote>

                   <blockquote><p>
Recent high-profile incidents in open-source software have greatly raised practitioner attention on software
supply chain attacks. To guard against potential malicious package updates, security practitioners advocate
pinning dependency to specific versions rather than floating in version ranges. However, it remains controversial whether pinning carries a meaningful security benefit that outweighs the cost of maintaining
outdated and possibly vulnerable dependencies. In this paper, we quantify, through counterfactual analysis and
simulations, the security and maintenance impact of version constraints in the npm ecosystem. By simulating
dependency resolutions over historical time points, we find that pinning direct dependencies not only (as
expected) increases the cost of maintaining vulnerable and outdated dependencies, but also (surprisingly) even
increases the risk of exposure to malicious package updates in larger dependency graphs due to the specifics
of npm’s dependency resolution mechanism. Finally, we explore collective pinning strategies to secure the
ecosystem against supply chain attacks, suggesting specific changes to npm to enable such interventions. Our
study provides guidance for practitioners and tool designers to manage their supply chains more securely.

                   <blockquote><p>
        Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly embedded into software products across diverse industries, enhancing user experiences, but at the same time introducing numerous challenges for developers. Unique characteristics of LLMs force developers, who are accustomed to traditional software development and evaluation, out of their comfort zones as the LLM components shatter standard assumptions about software systems. This study explores the emerging solutions that software developers are adopting to navigate the encountered challenges. Leveraging a mixed-method research, including 26 interviews and a survey with 332 responses, the study identifies 19 emerging solutions regarding quality assurance that practitioners across several product teams at Microsoft are exploring. The findings provide valuable insights that can guide the development and evaluation of LLM-based products more broadly in the face of these challenges.

                   <blockquote><p>
        Machine learning models make mistakes, yet sometimes it is difficult to identify the systematic problems behind the mistakes. Practitioners engage in various activities, including error analysis, testing, auditing, and red-teaming, to form hypotheses of what can go (or has gone) wrong with their models. To validate these hypotheses, practitioners employ data slicing to identify examples relevant to their hypotheses. However, traditional data slicing is limited by available features and programmatic slicing functions. In this work, we propose SemSlicer, a framework that supports semantic data slicing, which identifies a semantically coherent slice, without the need for existing features. SemSlicer uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to annotate datasets and generate slices from any user-defined slicing criteria. We show that SemSlicer generates accurate slices with low cost, allows flexible trade-offs between different design dimensions, reliably identifies under-performing data slices, and helps practitioners identify useful data slices that reflect systematic problems.

        Machine learning (ML) components are increasingly incorporated into software products for end-users, but developers face challenges in transitioning from ML prototypes to products. Academics have limited access to the source of commercial ML products, challenging research progress. In this study, first, we contribute a novel process to identify 262 open-source ML products among more than half a million ML-related projects on GitHub. Then, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze 30 open-source ML products to answer six broad research questions about development practices and system architecture. We find that the majority of the ML products in our sample represent startup-style development reported in past interview studies. We report 21 findings, including limited involvement of data scientists in many ML products, unusually low modularity between ML and non-ML code, diverse architectural choices on incorporating models into products, and limited prevalence of industry best practices such as model testing, pipeline automation, and monitoring. Additionally, we discuss 7 implications of this study on research, development, and education, including the need for tools to assist teams without data scientists, education opportunities, and open-source-specific research for privacy-preserving telemetry.

                   <blockquote><p>Many developers relying on open-source digital infrastructure expect continuous maintenance, but even the most critical packages can become unmaintained. Despite this, there is little understanding of the prevalence of abandonment of widely-used packages, of subsequent exposure, and of reactions to abandonment in practice, or the factors that influence them. We perform a large-scale quantitative analysis of all widely-used npm packages and find that abandonment is common among them, that abandonment exposes many projects which often do not respond, that responses correlate with other dependency management practices, and that removal is significantly faster when a projects end-of-life status is explicitly stated. We end with recommendations to both researchers and practitioners who are facing dependency abandonment or are sunsetting projects, such as opportunities for low-effort transparency mechanisms to help exposed projects make better, more informed decisions.</p></blockquote>

                   <blockquote><p>With the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), concerns about AI applications causing unforeseen harms to safety, privacy, security, and fairness are intensifying. While attempts to create regulations are underway, with initiatives such as the EU AI Act and the 2023 White House executive order, skepticism abounds as to the efficacy of such regulations. This paper explores an interdisciplinary approach to designing policy for the explainability of AI-based products, as the widely discussed &quot;right to explanation&quot; in the EU General Data Protection Regulation is ambiguous. To develop practical guidance for explainability, we conducted an experimental study that involved continuous collaboration among a team of researchers with AI and policy backgrounds over the course of ten weeks. The objective was to determine whether, through interdisciplinary effort, we can reach consensus on a policy for explainability in AI—one that is clearer, and more actionable and enforceable than current provisions. We share nine observations, derived from an iterative policy design process, which included drafting the policy, attempting to comply with it (or circumvent it), and collectively evaluating its effectiveness on a weekly basis. The observations include: iterative and continuous feedback was useful to improve policy drafts over time, discussing what evidence would satisfy policy was necessary during policy design, and human-subject studies were found to be necessary evidence to ensure effectiveness. We conclude with a note of optimism, arguing that meaningful policies can be achieved within a moderate time frame and with limited experience in policy design, as demonstrated by our student researchers on the team. This holds promising implications for policymakers, signaling that practical and effective regulation for AI applications is attainable.</p></blockquote>

        Current model testing work has mostly focused on creating test cases. Identifying what to test is a step that is largely ignored and poorly supported. We propose Weaver, an interactive tool that supports requirements elicitation for guiding model testing. Weaver uses large language models to generate knowledge bases and recommends concepts from them interactively, allowing testers to elicit requirements for further testing. Weaver provides rich external knowledge to testers and encourages testers to systematically explore diverse concepts beyond their own biases. In a user study, we show that both NLP experts and non-experts identified more, as well as more diverse concepts worth testing when using Weaver. Collectively, they found more than 200 failing test cases for stance detection with zero-shot ChatGPT. Our case studies further show that Weaver can help practitioners test models in real-world settings, where developers define more nuanced application scenarios (e.g., code understanding and transcript summarization) using LLMs.

                   <blockquote><p>
While lots of research has explored how to prevent maintainers from abandoning the open-source projects that serve as our digital infrastructure, there are very few insights on addressing abandonment when it occurs. We argue open-source sustainability research must expand its focus beyond trying to keep particular projects alive, to also cover the sustainable use of open source by supporting users when they face potential or actual abandonment.
We perform an interview study with 33 developers who have experienced open-source dependency abandonment and analyze the data using iterative thematic analysis. Often, multiple strategies were used to cope with abandonment, for example, first reaching out to the community to find potential alternatives, then switching to a community-accepted alternative if one exists. We found many developers felt they had little to no support or guidance when facing abandonment, leaving them to figure out what to do through a trial-and-error process on their own.
Abandonment introduces cost for otherwise seemingly free dependencies, but users can decide whether and how to prepare for abandonment through a number of different strategies, such as dependency monitoring, building abstraction layers, and community involvement. In many cases, community members can invest in resources that help others facing the same abandoned dependency, but often do not because of the many other competing demands on their time – in a form of the volunteer's dilemma. We discuss cost reduction strategies and ideas to overcome this volunteers dilemma. Our findings can be used directly by open-source users seeking resources on dealing with dependency abandonment, or by researchers to motivate future work supporting the sustainable use of open source.

Incorporating machine learning (ML) components into software products raises new software-engineering challenges and elevates already existing challenges. Many researchers have invested significant effort into understanding the challenges of industry practitioners working on building products with ML components through interviews and surveys with practitioners. With the intention to aggregate and present their collective findings, we conduct a meta-summary study: We collect 50 relevant papers that together interacted with over 4758 practitioners using guidelines for systematic literature reviews and subsequently group and organize the over 500 mentions of challenges within those papers. We highlight the most commonly reported challenges and how this meta-summary will be a useful resource for the research community to prioritize research and education in this field.

The documentation practice for machine-learned (ML) models often
falls short of established practices for traditional software, which
impedes model accountability and inadvertently abets inappropriate 
or misuse of models. Recently, model cards, a proposal for model
documentation, have attracted notable attention, but their impact
on the actual practice is unclear. In this work, we systematically
study the model documentation in the field and investigate how
to encourage more responsible and accountable documentation
practice. Our analysis of publicly available model cards reveals a
substantial gap between the proposal and the practice. We then
designed a tool named DocML aiming to (1) nudge the data scientists 
to comply with the model cards proposal during the model
development, especially the sections related to ethics, and (2) assess
and manage the documentation quality. A lab study reveals the
benefit of our tool towards long-term documentation quality and

        Data science pipelines to train and evaluate models with machine learning may contain bugs just like any other code. Leakage between training and test data can lead to overestimating the model's accuracy during offline evaluations, possibly leading to deployment of low-quality models in production. Such leakage can happen easily by mistake or by following poor practices but may be tedious and challenging to detect manually. We develop a static analysis approach to detect common forms of data leakage in data science code. Our evaluation shows that our analysis accurately detects data leakage and that such leakage is pervasive among over 100,000 analyzed public notebooks. We discuss how our static analysis approach can help both practitioners and educators, and how leakage prevention can be designed into the development process.

                   <blockquote><p>
        One of the key differences between traditional software engineering and machine learning (ML) is the lack of specifications for ML models. Traditionally, specifications provide a cornerstone for compositional reasoning and for the divide-and-conquer strategy of how we build large and complex systems from components, but these are hard to come by for machine learned components. While the lack of specification seems like a fundamental new problem at first sight, in fact, software engineers routinely deal with iffy specifications in practice. We face weak specifications, wrong specifications, and unanticipated interactions among specifications. ML may push us further, but the problems are not fundamentally new. Rethinking ML model composition from the perspective of the feature-interaction problem highlights the importance of software design.

        The introduction of machine learning (ML) components in software
projects has created the need for software engineers to collaborate with data scientists and other specialists. While collaboration
can always be challenging, ML introduces additional challenges
with its exploratory model development process, additional skills
and knowledge needed, difficulties testing ML systems, need for
continuous evolution and monitoring, and non-traditional quality
requirements such as fairness and explainability. Through interviews with 45 practitioners from 28 organizations, we identified
key collaboration challenges that teams face when building and
deploying ML systems into production. We report on common collaboration points in the development of production ML systems
for requirements, data, and integration, as well as corresponding
team patterns and challenges. We find that most of these challenges
center around communication, documentation, engineering, and
process and collect recommendations to address these challenges

        Online toxicity is ubiquitous across the internet and its negative impact on the people and online communities it effects has been well documented.
However, toxicity manifests differently on various platforms and toxicity in open source communities, while frequently discussed, is not well understood.
We take a first stride at understanding the characteristics of open source toxicity to better inform future work designing effective intervention and detection methods. To this end, we curate a sample of 100 toxic GitHub issue discussions combining multiple search and sampling strategies. We then qualitatively analyze the sample to gain an understanding of the characteristics of open-source toxicity.
We find that the prevalent forms of toxicity in open source differ from those observed on other platforms like Reddit or Wikipedia. We find some of the most prevalent forms of toxicity in open source are entitled, demanding, and arrogant comments from project users and insults arising from technical disagreements. In addition, not all toxicity was written by people external to the projects, project members were also common authors of toxicity.
We also provide in-depth discussions about the implications of our findings including patterns that may be useful for detection work and subsequent questions for future work.

        Determining whether a configurable software system has a performance bug or the system was misconfigured is often challenging. While there are numerous debugging techniques that can support developers in this task, there is limited empirical evidence of how useful the techniques are to address the actual needs that developers have when debugging the performance of configurable systems; most techniques are often evaluated in terms of technical accuracy instead of their usability. In this paper, we take a human-centered approach to identify, design, implement, and evaluate a solution to support developers in the process of debugging the performance of configurable software systems. We first conduct an exploratory study with 19 developers to identify the information needs that developers have during this process. Subsequently, we design and implement a tailored tool, building on relevant information provided by Global and Local performance-influence models, CPU profiling, and program slicing, to support those needs. Two user studies, with a total of 20 developers, validate and confirm that the information that we provide help developers debug the performance of configurable software systems.

        Data scientists reportedly spend a significant amountof  their  time  in  their  daily  routines  on  data  wrangling,  
        i.e., cleaning  data  and  extracting  features.  However,  data  wrangling code  is  often  repetitive  and  error-prone 
        to  write.  Moreover,  itis  easy  to  introduce  subtle  bugs  when  reusing  and  adopting existing  code,  which  result 
        not  in  crashes  but  reduce  model quality.   To   support   data   scientists   with   data   wrangling,   we present

        Automatically repairing a bugging program is essentially a search problem, searching for code transformations that pass a set of tests. Various search strategies have been explored, but they either navigate the search space in an ad hoc way using heuristics, or systemically but at the cost of limited edit expressiveness in the kinds of supported program edits. In this work, we explore the possibility of systematically navigating the search space without sacrificing edit expressiveness. The key enabler of this exploration is variational execution, a dynamic analysis technique that has been shown to be effective at exploring many similar executions in large search spaces. We evaluate our approach on IntroClassJava and Defects4J, showing that a systematic search is effective at leveraging and combining fixing ingredients to find patches, including many high-quality patches and multi-edit patches.

            Open source software projects often rely on package management systems that help projects discover,
incorporate, and maintain dependencies on other packages, maintained by other people. Such systems save a
great deal of effort over adhoc ways of advertising, packaging, and transmitting useful libraries, but coordination
among project teams is still needed when one package makes a breaking change affecting other packages.
Ecosystems differ in their approaches to breaking changes, and there is no general theory to explain the
relationships between features, behavioral norms, ecosystem outcomes, and motivating values. We address this
through two empirical studies. In an interview case study we contrast Eclipse, NPM, and CRAN, demonstrating
that these different norms for coordination of breaking changes shift the costs of using and maintaining the
software among stakeholders, appropriate to each ecosystem’s mission. In a second study, we combine a
survey, repository mining, and document analysis to broaden and systematize these observations across 18
ecosystems. We find that all ecosystems share values such as stability and compatibility, but differ in other
values. Ecosystems’ practices often support their espoused values, but in surprisingly diverse ways. The data
provides counterevidence against easy generalizations about why ecosystem communities do what they do.</p></blockquote>

		Performance-influence models can help stakeholders understand how and where configuration options and their interactions influence the performance of a system. With this understanding, stakeholders can debug performance and make deliberate configuration decisions. Current black-box techniques to build such models combine various sampling and learning strategies, resulting in trade offs between measurement effort, accuracy, and interpretability. We present Comprex, a white-box approach to build performance-influence models for configurable systems, combining insights of local measurements, dynamic taint analysis to track options in the implementation, compositionality, and compression of the configuration space, without using machine learning to extrapolate incomplete samples. Our evaluation on 4 widely-used open-source projects demonstrates that Comprex builds similarly accurate performance-influence models to the most accurate and expensive black-box approach, but at a reduced cost and with additional benefits from interpretable and local models.

		The large amount of third-party packages available in fast-moving software ecosystems, such as the Node.js/npm, enables attackers to compromise applications by pushing malicious updates to their package dependencies. Studying the npm repository, we observed that many packages perform only simple computations and do not need access to filesystem or network APIs. This offers the opportunity to enforce least-privilege design per package, protecting them from malicious updates. We discuss the design space and propose a lightweight permission system that protects Node.js/npm applications by enforcing package permissions at runtime. Our system makes a large number of packages much harder to be exploited, almost for free.

        Higher-order mutation has the potential for improving major drawbacks of traditional first-order mutation, such as by simulating more realistic faults or improving test optimization techniques. Despite interest in studying promising higher-order mutants, such mutants are difficult to find due to the exponential search space of mutation combinations. State-of-the-art approaches rely on genetic search, which is often incomplete and expensive due to its stochastic nature. First, we propose a novel way of finding a complete set of higher-order mutants by using variational execution, a technique that can, in many cases, explore large search spaces completely and often efficiently. Second, we use the identified complete set of higher-order mutants to study their characteristics. Finally, we use the identified characteristics to design and evaluate a new search strategy, independent of variational execution, that is highly effective at finding higher-order mutants even in large code bases.

However, neither academic nor practitioner publications seem to distinguish these two concepts. We argue that a distinction is valuable, as applications, goals, and challenges differ fundamentally between feature flags and configuration options. In this work, we explore the differences and commonalities of both concepts to help understand practices and challenges and to help transfer existing solutions (e.g., for testing). To better understand feature flags and how they relate to configuration options, we performed nine semi-structured interviews with feature-flag experts. We discovered a number of distinguishing characteristics but also opportunities for knowledge and technology transfer across both communities. Overall, we think that both communities can learn from each other.

            Open source is ubiquitous and critical infrastructure, yet funding and sustaining it is challenging. While there are many different funding models for open-source donations and concerted efforts through foundations, donation platforms like Paypal, Patreon, or OpenCollective are popular and low-bar forms to raise funds for open-source development, for which GitHub recently even built explicit support. With a mixed-method study, we explore the emerging and largely unexplored phenomenon of donations in open source: We quantify how commonly open-source projects ask for donations, statistically model characteristics of projects that ask for and receive donations, analyze for what the requested funds are needed and used, and assess whether the received donations achieve the intended outcomes. We find 25,885 projects asking for donations on GitHub, often to support engineering activities; however, we also find no clear evidence that donations influence the activity level of a project. In fact, we find that donations are used in a multitude of ways, raising new research questions about effective funding.

The notion of forking has changed with the rise of distributed version control systems and social coding environments, like GitHub. Traditionally forking refers to splitting off an independent development branch (which we call hard forks); research on hard forks, conducted mostly in pre-GitHub days showed that hard forks were often seen critical as they may fragment a community. Today, in social forking environments, open-source developers are encouraged to fork a project in order to integrate contributions to the community (which we call social forks), which may have also influenced perceptions and practices around hard forks. To revisit hard forks, we identify, study and classify 15,306 hard forks on GitHub and interview 18 owners of hard forks or forked repositories. We find that, among others, hard forks often evolve out of social forks rather than being planned deliberately and that perception about hard forks have indeed changed dramatically, seeing them often as a positive non-competitive alternative to the original project.        </p></blockquote>

            The advent of variability management and generator technology enables users to derive individual system variants from a configurable code base by selecting desired configuration options.
This approach gives rise to the generation of possibly billions of variants, which, however, cannot be efficiently analyzed for bugs and other properties with classic analysis techniques.
To address this issue, researchers and practitioners have developed sampling heuristics and, recently, variability-aware analysis techniques.
While sampling reduces the analysis effort significantly, the information obtained is necessarily incomplete, and it is unknown whether state-of-the-art sampling techniques scale to billions of variants.
Variability-aware analysis techniques process the configurable code base directly, exploiting similarities among individual variants with the goal of reducing analysis effort.
However, while being promising, so far, variability-aware analysis techniques have been applied mostly only to small academic examples.
To learn about the mutual strengths and weaknesses of variability-aware and sample-based static-analysis techniques, we compared the two by means of seven concrete control-flow and data-flow analyses, applied to five real-world subject systems: BusyBox, OpenSSL, SQLite, the x86 Linux kernel, and uclibc.
In particular, we compare the efficiency (analysis execution time) of the static analyses and their effectiveness (potential bugs found).
Overall, we found that variability-aware analysis outperforms most sample-based static-analysis techniques with respect to efficiency and effectiveness.
For example, checking all variants of OpenSSL with a variability-aware static analysis is faster than checking even only two variants with an analysis that does not exploit  similarities among variants.</p></blockquote>

            Variational execution is a novel dynamic analysis technique for exploring
            highly configurable systems and accurately tracking information flow. It is
            able to efficiently analyze many configurations by aggressively sharing
            redundancies of program executions. The idea of variational execution has been
            demonstrated to be effective in exploring variations in the program, especially
            when the configuration space grows out of control. Existing implementations of
            variational execution often require heavy lifting of the runtime interpreter,
            which is painstaking and error-prone. Furthermore, the performance of this
            approach is suboptimal. For example, the state-of-the-art variational execution
            interpreter for Java, VarexJ, slows down executions by 100 to 800~times over a
            single execution for small to medium size Java programs. Instead of modifying
            existing JVMs, we propose to transform existing bytecode to make it
            variational, so it can be executed on an unmodified commodity JVM.  Our
            evaluation shows a dramatic improvement on performance over the
            state-of-the-art, with a speedup of 2 to 46 times, and high efficiency in
            sharing computations.

We investigate which qualities maintainers intend to signal and how well badges correlate with those qualities. After surveying developers, mining 294,941 repositories, and applying statistical modeling and time series analysis techniques, we find that non-trivial badges, which display the build status, test coverage, and up-to-dateness of dependencies, are mostly reliable signals, correlating with more tests, better pull requests, and fresher dependencies. Displaying such badges correlates with best practices, but the effects do not always persist.

    	Fork-based development has been widely used both in open source community and industry, because it gives developers flexibility to modify their own fork without affecting others. Unfortunately, this mechanism has downsides; when the number of forks becomes large, it is difficult for developers to get or maintain an overview of activities in the forks. Current tools provide little help. We introduced INFOX, an approach to automatically identifies not-merged features in forks and generates an overview of active forks in a project. The approach clusters cohesive code fragments using code and network analysis techniques and uses information-retrieval techniques to label clusters with keywords. The clustering is effective, with 90% accuracy on a set of known features. In addition, a human-subject evaluation shows that INFOX can provide actionable insight for developers of forks.

                Highly configurable software systems are pervasive, although configuration options and their interactions raise complexity
                of the program and increase maintenance effort. Especially load-time configuration options, such as parameters from command-line
                options or configuration files, are used with standard programming constructs such as variables and if-statements intermixed with the
                program’s implementation; manually tracking configuration options from the time they are loaded to the point where they may influence
                control-flow decisions is tedious and error prone. We design and implement LOTRACK , an extended static taint analysis to track
                configuration options automatically. LOTRACK derives a configuration map that explains for each code fragment under which
                configurations it may be executed. An evaluation on Android apps and Java applications from different domains shows that LOTRACK
                yields high accuracy with reasonable performance. We use LOTRACK to empirically characterize how much of the implementation of
                Android apps depends on the platform’s configuration options or interactions of these options.

        Modern software systems provide many configuration 
        options which not only influence their functionality but also
        non-functional properties such as response-time. To understand
        and predict the effect of configuration options, several sampling,
        analysis, and learning strategies have been proposed, albeit often
        with significant cost to cover the highly dimensional configuration
        space. Recently, transfer learning has been applied to reduce
        the effort of constructing performance models by transferring
        knowledge about performance behavior across environments.
        While this line of research is promising to learn more accurate
        models at lower cost, it is unclear until now why and when
        transfer learning works for performance modeling and analysis in
        highly configurable systems. To shed light on when it is beneficial
        to apply transfer learning, we conducted an empirical study on
        four popular software systems, varying software configurations
        and environmental conditions, such as hardware, workload, and
        software versions, to identify the key knowledge pieces that can
        be exploited for transfer learning. Our results show that in small
        environmental changes (e.g., homogeneous workload change), by
        applying a linear transformation to the performance model of
        the source environment, we can understand the performance behavior 
        of the target environment, while for severe environmental
        changes (e.g., drastic workload change) we can transfer only
        knowledge that makes sampling in the target environment more
        efficient, e.g., by reducing the dimensionality of the configuration
        space.

        The C preprocessor is used in many C projects to support variability and portability. However, researchers and practitioners
        criticize the C preprocessor because of its negative effect on code understanding and maintainability and its error proneness. More
        importantly, the use of the preprocessor hinders the development of tool support that is standard in other languages, such as automated
        refactoring. Developers aggravate these problems when using the preprocessor in undisciplined ways (e.g., conditional blocks that do
          not align with the syntactic structure of the code). In this article, we proposed a catalogue of refactorings and we evaluated the number
        of application possibilities of the refactorings in practice, the opinion of developers about the usefulness of the refactorings, and whether
        the refactorings preserve behavior. Overall, we found 5670 application possibilities for the refactorings in 63 real-world C projects. In
        addition, we performed an online survey among 246 developers, and we submitted 28 patches to convert undisciplined directives into
        disciplined ones. According to our results, 63% of developers prefer to use the refactored (i.e., disciplined) version of the code instead
        of the original code with undisciplined preprocessor usage. To verify that the refactorings are indeed behavior preserving, we applied
        them to more than 36 thousand programs generated automatically using a model of a subset of the C language, running the same
        test cases in the original and refactored programs. Furthermore, we applied the refactorings to three real-world projects: BusyBox,
        OpenSSL, and SQLite. This way, we detected and fixed a few behavioral changes, 62% caused by unspecified behavior in the C
        programming language.

        Quality assurance for highly-configurable systems is challenging due to the exponentially growing configuration space. 
        Interactions among multiple options can lead to surprising behaviors, bugs, and security vulnerabilities.
        Analyzing all configurations systematically might be possible though if most options do
        not interact or interactions follow specific patterns that can be exploited by
        analysis tools.
        To better understand interactions in practice, we analyze program traces to identify where interactions occur on control flow and data.
        To this end, we developed a dynamic analysis for Java based on variability-aware execution and monitor executions
        of multiple mid-sized real-world programs.
        We find that the essential configuration complexity of these programs is indeed much lower than
        the combinatorial explosion of the configuration space indicates, but also that
        the interaction characteristics that allow scalable and complete analyses are more nuanced than
        what is exploited by existing state-of-the-art quality assurance strategies.

            for users of a package, but often developers can invest additional 
            effort or accept opportunity costs to alleviate or delay
            downstream costs. We performed a multiple case study of

    Almost every software system provides configuration options
    to tailor the system to the target platform and application
    scenario. Often, this configurability renders the analysis of
    every individual system configuration infeasible. To address
    this problem, researchers proposed a diverse set of sampling
    algorithms. We present a comparative study of 10 state-of-the-art
    sampling algorithms regarding their fault-detection
    capability and size of sample sets. The former is important
    to improve software quality and the latter to reduce the
    time of analysis. In a nutshell, we found that the sampling
    algorithms with larger sample sets detected higher numbers
    of faults. Furthermore, we observed that the limiting assumptions
    made in previous work influence the number of
    detected faults, the size of sample sets, and the ranking of

    Almost every complex software system today is configurable.
    While configurability has many benefits, it challenges
    performance prediction, optimization, and debugging.
    Often, the influences of the individual configurations options on performance
    is unknown. Worse, configuration options may interact, giving rise to a
    configuration space of possibly exponential size. Addressing this
    challenge, we propose an approach that derives a <em>performance-influence model</em>
    for a given configurable system, describing all <em>relevant</em>
    influences of configuration options and their interactions. Such a model
    shall be useful for automatic performance prediction and optimization,
    on the one hand, and performance debugging for developers, on the other
    hand. Our approach combines
    machine-learning and sampling technique in a novel way. Our approach
    improves over standard
    techniques in that it (1) represents influences of options and their
    interactions explicitly (which eases debugging), (2) smoothly integrates
    binary and numeric configuration options for the first time, (3) incorporates
    domain knowledge, if available (which eases learning and
    increases accuracy), (4) considers complex constraints among options, and
     (5) systematically reduces the solution space to a tractable size. A
    series of experiments demonstrates the feasibility of our approach in
    terms of the accuracy of the models learned as well as the accuracy of
    the performances predictions one can make with them. Using our approach,
    we were able to identify a number of real performance bugs and other
    problems in real-world systems.

    During software maintenance, program slicing is a useful technique
    to assist developers in understanding the impact of their changes.
    While different program-slicing techniques have been proposed for
    traditional software systems, program slicing for dynamic web applications
    is challenging since the client-side code is <em>generated</em> from
    the server-side code and data entities are referenced across <em>different languages</em>
    and are often <em>embedded</em> in string literals in the server-side
    program. To address those challenges, we introduce WebSlice, an
    approach to compute program slices across different languages for
    web applications. We first identify data-flow dependencies among
    data entities for PHP code based on symbolic execution. We also
    compute SQL queries and a conditional DOM that represents client-code
    variations and construct the data flows for embedded languages:
    SQL, HTML, and JavaScript. Next, we connect the data flows across
    different languages and those across PHP pages. Finally, we compute

                Highly configurable systems allow users to tailor software to specific needs. Valid combinations of configuration options are
                often restricted by intricate constraints. Describing options and constraints in a variability model allows reasoning about the supported
                configurations. To automate creating and verifying such models, we need to identify the origin of such constraints. We propose a static
                analysis approach, based on two rules, to extract configuration constraints from code. We apply it on four highly configurable systems to
                evaluate the accuracy of our approach and to determine which constraints are recoverable from the code. We find that our approach is
                highly accurate (93 % and 77 % respectively) and that we can recover 28 % of existing constraints. We complement our approach with a
                qualitative study to identify constraint sources, triangulating results from our automatic extraction, manual inspections, and interviews
                with 27 developers. We find that, apart from low-level implementation dependencies, configuration constraints enforce correct runtime
                behavior, improve users’ configuration experience, and prevent corner cases. While the majority of constraints is extractable from code,
                our results indicate that creating a complete model requires further substantial domain knowledge and testing. Our results aim at
                supporting researchers and practitioners working on variability model engineering, evolution, and verification techniques.

                  The C preprocessor has received strong criticism in academia, among others regarding separation of concerns, error proneness, and code obfuscation, but is widely used in practice.
                  Many (mostly academic) alternatives to the preprocessor exist, but have not been adopted in practice.
                  Since developers continue to use the preprocessor despite all criticism and research, we ask how practitioners perceive the C preprocessor.
                  We performed interviews with 40 developers, used grounded theory to analyze the data, and cross-validated the results with data from a survey among 202 developers, repository mining, and results from previous studies.
                  In particular, we investigated four research questions related to why the preprocessor is still widely used in practice, common problems, alternatives, and the impact of undisciplined annotations.
                  Our study shows that developers are aware of the criticism the C preprocessor receives, but use it nonetheless, mainly for portability and variability.
                  They indicate that they regularly face preprocessor-related problems and preprocessor-related bugs.
                  The majority of our interviewees do not see any current C-native technologies that can entirely replace the C preprocessor.
                  However, developers tend to mitigate problems with guidelines, but those guidelines are not enforced consistently.
                  We report the key insights gained from our study and discuss implications for practitioners and researchers on how to better use the C preprocessor to minimize its negative impact.

              When developing and maintaining a software system, programmers often rely on
              IDEs to provide editor services such as syntax highlighting, auto-completion,
              and “jump to declaration”. In dynamic web applications, such tool support is
              currently limited to either the server-side code or to hand-written or
              generated client-side code. Our goal is to build a call graph for providing
              editor services on client-side code while it is still <em>embedded</em> as
              string literals within server-side code. First, we symbolically execute the
              server-side code to identify all possible client-side code variations.
              Subsequently, we parse the generated client-side code with all its variations
              into a <em>VarDOM</em> that compactly represents all DOM variations for further
              analysis. Based on VarDOM, we build conditional call graphs for embedded
              HTML, CSS, and JS. Our empirical evaluation on real-world web applications
              show that our analysis achieves 100 % precision in identifying
              call-graph edges. 62 % of the edges cross PHP strings, and 17 % of them cross files—in both situations, navigation
              without tool support is tedious and error prone.</p></blockquote>

In this context, there arises a need for variational data structures for efficiently representing and computing with related variants of an underlying data type. So far, variational data structures have been explored and developed ad hoc. This paper is a first attempt and a call to action for systematic and foundational research in this area. Research on variational data structures will benefit not only customizable software, but the many other application domains that must cope with variability. In this paper, we show how support for variation can be understood as a general and orthogonal property of data types, data structures, and algorithms. We begin a systematic exploration of basic variational data structures, exploring the tradeoffs between different implementations. Finally, we retrospectively analyze the design decisions in our own previous work where we have independently encountered problems requiring variational data structures.</p></blockquote>

    Software-product-line engineering has gained considerable momentum in recent years, both in industry and
    in academia. A software product line is a set of software products that share a common set of features.
    Software product lines challenge traditional analysis techniques, such as type checking, model checking,
    and theorem proving, in their quest of ensuring correctness and reliability of software. Simply creating and
    analyzing all products of a product line is usually not feasible, due to the potentially exponential number
    of valid feature combinations. Recently, researchers began to develop analysis techniques that take the
    distinguishing properties of software product lines into account, for example, by checking feature-related
    code in isolation or by exploiting variability information during analysis. The emerging field of product-line
    analyses is both broad and diverse, such that it is difficult for researchers and practitioners to understand
    their similarities and differences. We propose a classification of product-line analyses to enable systematic
    research and application. Based on our insights with classifying and comparing a corpus of 76 articles, we
    infer a research agenda to guide future research on product-line analyses.</p></blockquote>

              Program comprehension is an important cognitive process that inherently eludes direct measurement. Thus, researchers are struggling with providing optimal programming languages, tools, or coding conventions to support developers in their everyday work.
              With our approach, we explore whether <em>functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)</em>, which is well established in cognitive neuroscience, is feasible to directly measure program comprehension. To this end, we observed 17 participants inside an fMRI scanner while comprehending short source-code snippets, which we contrasted with locating syntax errors.
              We found a clear, distinct activation pattern of five brain regions, which are related to working memory, attention, and language processing—all processes that fit well to our understanding of program comprehension. Based on the results, we propose a model of program comprehension.
              Our results encourage us to use fMRI in future studies to measure program comprehension and, in the long run, answer questions, such as: Can we predict whether someone will be an excellent programmer? How effective are new languages and tools for program understanding? How do we train someone to become an excellent programmer?

                  In plugin-based systems, plugin conflicts may occur when two or more
                  plugins interfere with one another, changing their expected
                  behaviors.
                  It is highly challenging to detect plugin conflicts due to the
                  exponential explosion of the combinations of plugins (i.e.,
                  configurations). In this paper, we address the challenge of executing
                  a test case over many configurations. Leveraging the fact that many
                  executions of a test are similar, our variability-aware execution runs
                  common code once. Only when encountering values that are different
                  depending on specific configurations will the execution split to run
                  for each of them. To evaluate the scalability of variability-aware
                  execution on a large real-world setting, we built a prototype PHP
                  interpreter called Varex and ran it on the popular WordPress
                  blogging Web application. The results show that while plugin
                  interactions exist, there is a significant amount of sharing that
                  allows variability-aware execution to scale to 2^50 configurations
                  within seven minutes of running time. During our study, with Varex, we were
                  able to detect two plugin conflicts: one was recently reported on
                  WordPress forum, and another one is not yet discovered.

                Highly-configurable systems allow users to tailor the software to
                their specific needs. Not all combinations of configuration options
                are valid though, and constraints arise for technical or non-technical
                reasons. Explicitly describing these constraints in a variability model
                allows reasoning about the supported configurations. To automate
                creating variability models, we need to identify the origin of such
                configuration constraints. We propose an approach which uses build-time
                errors and a novel feature-effect heuristic to automatically
                extract configuration constraints from C code. We conduct an empirical
                study on four highly-configurable open-source systems with
                existing variability models having three objectives in mind: evaluate
                the accuracy of our approach, determine the recoverability of existing
                variability-model constraints using our analysis, and classify the
                sources of variability-model constraints. We find that both our extraction
                heuristics are highly accurate (93 % and 77 % respectively),
                and that we can recover 19 % of the existing variability-models
                using our approach. However, we find that many of the remaining
                constraints require expert knowledge or more expensive analyses.
                We argue that our approach, tooling, and experimental results support
                researchers and practitioners working on variability model
                re-engineering, evolution, and consistency-checking techniques.

              implementation techniques for product lines lack proper interfaces, which could make
              such dependencies explicit. As alternative to changing the implementation approach, we
              provide a comprehensive tool-based solution to support developers in recognizing and
              dealing with feature dependencies: emergent interfaces. Emergent interfaces are computed
              on demand, based on feature-sensitive <em>interprocedural</em> data-flow analysis. They emerge
              in the IDE and emulate benefits of modularity not available in the host language. To
              evaluate the potential of emergent interfaces, we conducted and replicated a
              controlled experiment, and found, in the studied context, that emergent interfaces
              can improve performance of code change tasks by up to 3 times while also reducing
              the number of errors.

                However, adopting a product-line approach poses a major challenge and significant risks, since typically legacy code must be migrated toward a product line. Our aim is to lower the adoption barrier by providing semiautomatic tool support—called <em>variability mining</em>—to support developers in locating, documenting, and extracting implementations of product-line features from legacy code. Variability mining combines prior work on concern location, reverse engineering, and variability-aware type systems, but is tailored specifically for the use in product lines. Our work pursues three technical goals: (1) we provide a <em>consistency indicator</em> based on a variability-aware type system, (2) we mine features at a <em>fine level of granularity</em>, and (3) we exploit <em>domain knowledge</em> about the relationship between features when available. With a quantitative study, we demonstrate that variability mining can efficiently support developers in locating features.</p></blockquote>

While standardization has empowered the software industry to substantially scale software development and to provide affordable software to a broad market, it often does not address smaller market segments, nor the needs and wishes of individual customers.  Software product lines reconcile mass production and standardization with mass customization in software engineering. Ideally, based on a set of reusable parts, a software manufacturer can generate a software product based on the requirements of its customer. The concept of features is central to achieving this level of automation, because features bridge the gap between the requirements the customer has and the functionality a product provides. Thus features are a central concept in all phases of product-line development.

The authors take a developer’s viewpoint, focus on the development, maintenance, and implementation of product-line variability, and especially concentrate on automated product derivation based on a user’s feature selection.   The book consists of three parts. Part I provides a general introduction to feature-oriented software product lines, describing the product-line approach and introducing the product-line development process with its two elements of domain and application engineering. The pivotal Part II covers a wide variety of implementation techniques including design patterns, frameworks, components, feature-oriented programming, and aspect-oriented programming, as well as tool-based approaches including preprocessors, build systems, version-control systems, and virtual separation of concerns. Finally, Part III is devoted to advanced topics related to feature-oriented product lines like refactoring, feature interaction, and  analysis tools specific to product lines. In addition, an Appendix lists various helpful tools for software product-line development, along with a description of how they relate to the topics covered in this book.

To tie the book together, the authors use two running examples that are well documented in the product-line literature: data management for embedded systems, and variations of graph data structures. They start every chapter by explicitly stating the respective learning goals and finish it with a set of exercises; additional teaching material is also available online. All these features make the book ideally suited for teaching – both for academic classes and for professionals interested in self-study.

Module systems enable a divide and conquer strategy to software development.
To implement compile-time variability in software product lines, modules
can be composed in different combinations. However, this way variability
dictates a dominant decomposition. Instead, we introduce a variability-aware
module system that supports compile-time variability <em>inside</em> a module and its
interface. This way, each module can be considered a product line that can
be type checked in isolation. Variability can crosscut multiple modules. The
module system breaks with the antimodular tradition of a global variability
model in product-line development and provides a path toward software
ecosystems and product lines of product lines developed in an open fashion.
We discuss the design and implementation of such a module system on a core
calculus and provide an implementation for C, which we use to type check
the open source product line Busybox with 811 compile-time options.

                   <blockquote><p>Software-product-line engineering aims at the development of variable
    and reusable software systems. In practice, software product lines are
    often implemented with preprocessors. Preprocessor directives are easy to use,
    and many mature tools are available for practitioners. However, preprocessor
    directives have been heavily criticized in academia and even referred to
    as “#ifdef hell”, because they introduce threats to program comprehension
    and correctness. There are many voices that suggest to use other implementation
    techniques instead, but these voices ignore the fact that a transition
    from preprocessors to other languages and tools is tedious, erroneous, and expensive
    in practice. Instead, we and others propose to increase the readability
    of preprocessor directives by using background colors to highlight source code
    annotated with ifdef directives. In three controlled experiments with over 70
    subjects in total, we evaluate whether and how background colors improve
    program comprehension in preprocessor-based implementations. Our results
    demonstrate that background colors have the potential to improve program
    comprehension, independently of size and programming language of the underlying
    product. Additionally, we found that subjects generally favor background
    colors. We integrate these and other findings in a tool called FeatureCommander,
    which facilitates program comprehension in practice and which can serve
    as a basis for further research.</p></blockquote>

            Customizable programs and program families
            provide user-selectable features to tailor a program to an
            application scenario. Knowing in advance which feature selection
            yields the best performance is difficult because a
            direct measurement of all possible feature combinations is
            infeasible. Our work aims at predicting program performance
            based on selected features. The challenge is predicting performance
            accurately when features interact. An interaction
            occurs when a feature combination has an unexpected influence

Although superimposition is a general-purpose concept, it has been (re)invented and implemented individually for various kinds of software artifacts. We unify languages and tools that rely on superimposition by using the language-independent model of <em>feature structure trees</em> (FSTs). On the basis of the FST model, we propose a general approach to the composition of software artifacts written in different languages. Furthermore, we offer a supporting framework and tool chain, called FeatureHouse. We use attribute grammars to automate the integration of additional languages. In particular, we have integrated Java, C#, C, Haskell, Alloy, and JavaCC. A substantial number of case studies demonstrate the practicality and scalability of our approach and reveal insights into the properties that a language must have in order to be ready for superimposition. We discuss perspectives of our approach and demonstrate how we extended FeatureHouse with support for XML languages (in particular, XHTML, XMI/UML, and Ant) and alternative composition approaches (in particular, aspect weaving). Rounding off our previous work, we provide here a holistic view of the FeatureHouse approach based on rich experience with numerous languages and case studies and reflections on several years of research.</p></blockquote>

                   <blockquote><p>Modularity of feature representations has been a long standing
                    goal of feature-oriented software development. While
                    some researchers regard feature modules and corresponding
                    composition mechanisms as a modular solution, other researchers
                    have challenged the notion of feature modularity
                    and pointed out that most feature-oriented implementation
                    mechanisms lack proper interfaces and support neither modular
                    type checking nor separate compilation. We step back
                    and reflect on the feature-modularity discussion. We distinguish
                    two notions of modularity, <em>cohesion</em> without interfaces
                    and <em>information hiding</em> with interfaces, and point out the
                    different expectations that, we believe, are the root of many
                    heated discussions. We discuss whether feature interfaces
                    should be desired and weigh their potential benefits and
                    costs, specifically regarding crosscutting, granularity, feature
                    interactions, and the distinction between closed-world and
                    open-world reasoning. Because existing evidence for and
                    against feature modularity and feature interfaces is shaky

                   <blockquote><p>
                    In many projects, lexical preprocessors are used to manage
                    different variants of the project (using conditional compilation)
                    and to define compile-time code transformations (using
                    macros). Unfortunately, while being a simply way to implement
                    variability, conditional compilation and lexical macros
                    hinder automatic analysis, even though such analysis would
                    be urgently needed to combat variability-induced complexity.
                    To analyze code with its variability, we need to parse
                    it without preprocessing it. However, current parsing solutions
                    use heuristics, support only a subset of the language, or
                    suffer from exponential explosion. As part of the TypeChef
                    project, we contribute a novel variability-aware parser that
                    can parse unpreprocessed code without heuristics in practicable
                    time. Beyond the obvious task of detecting syntax errors,
                    our parser paves the road for further analysis, such as
                    variability-aware type checking. We implement variabilityaware
                    parsers for Java and GNU C and demonstrate practicability
                    by parsing the product line MobileMedia and the
                    entire X86 architecture of the Linux kernel with 6065 variable
                    features.                          </p></blockquote>

            What is modularity? Which kind of modularity should developers strive for?
            Despite decades of research on modularity, these basic questions have
            no definite answer. We submit that the common understanding of
            modularity, and in particular its notion of information hiding, is
            deeply rooted in classical logic.
            We analyze how classical modularity, based on classical logic, fails to
            address the needs of developers of large software systems, and
            encourage researchers to explore alternative visions of
            modularity, based on nonclassical logics, and henceforth called
            nonclassical
            modularity.</p></blockquote>

            Software-product-line engineering is an efficient means to generate a family of program variants for a domain
            from a single code base. However, because of the potentially high number of possible program variants, it is
            difficult to test them all and ensure properties like type safety for the entire product line. We present a
            product-line–aware type system that can type check an entire software product line without generating each variant in
            isolation. Specifically, we extend the Featherweight Java calculus with feature annotations for product-line development
            and prove formally that all program variants generated from a well-typed product line are well-typed.
            Furthermore, we present a solution to the problem of typing mutually exclusive features. We discuss how results

                   <blockquote><p>The C preprocessor cpp is a widely used tool for implementing
            variable software. It enables programmers to express
            variable code of features that may crosscut the entire implementation
            with conditional compilation. The C preprocessor
            relies on simple text processing and is independent of the host
            language (C, C++, Java, and so on). Language independent
            text processing is powerful and expressive|programmers can
            make all kinds of annotations in the form of #ifdefs but
            can render unpreprocessed code difficult to process automatically
            by tools, such as code aspect refactoring, concern
            management, and also static analysis and variability-aware
            type checking. We distinguish between disciplined annotations,
            which align with the underlying source-code structure,
            and undisciplined annotations, which do not align with the
            structure and hence complicate tool development. This distinction
            raises the question of how frequently programmers
            use undisciplined annotations and whether it is feasible to
            change them to disciplined annotations to simplify tool development
            and to enable programmers to use a wide variety of
            tools in the first place. By means of an analysis of 40 mediumsized
            to large-sized C programs, we show empirically that
            programmers use cpp mostly in a disciplined way: about 85 %
            of all annotations respect the underlying source-code structure.
            Furthermore, we analyze the remaining undisciplined
            annotations, identify patterns, and discuss how to transform
            them into a disciplined form.</p></blockquote>

                   <blockquote><p>
            Over 30 years ago, the preprocessor cpp was developed to
            extend the programming language C by lightweight metaprogramming
            capabilities. Despite its error-proneness and low
            abstraction level, the cpp is still widely being used in presentday
            software projects to implement variable software. However,
            not much is known about <em>how</em> the cpp is employed
            to implement variability. To address this issue, we have
            analyzed forty open-source software projects written in C.
            Specifically, we answer the following questions: How does program
            size influence variability? How complex are extensions
            made via cpp's variability mechanisms? At which level of
            granularity are extensions applied? What is the general type
            of extensions? These questions revive earlier discussions on
            understanding and refactoring of the preprocessor. To answer
            them, we introduce several metrics measuring the variability,
            complexity, granularity, and type of extensions. Based on
            the data obtained, we suggest alternative implementation
            techniques. The data we have collected can influence other
            research areas, such as language design and tool support.</p></blockquote>

                  à la AHEAD and virtual separation using annotations à la <em>#ifdef</em>
                  or CIDE are two competing groups of implementation approaches for
                  software product lines with complementary advantages. Although both
                  groups have been mainly discussed in isolation, we strive for an
                  integration to leverage the respective advantages. In this paper,
                  we provide the basis for such an integration by providing a model
                  that supports both, physical and virtual separation, and by describing
                  refactorings in both directions. We prove the refactorings complete,
                  such that every virtually separated product line can be automatically
                  transformed into a physically separated one (replacing annotations by refinements)
                  and vice versa. To demonstrate the feasibility of our approach, we have
                  implemented the refactorings in our tool CIDE and conducted four case studies.</p></blockquote>

                     Features express the variabilities and commonalities
                     among programs in a software product line (SPL). A feature
                     model defines the valid combinations of features, where each
                     combination corresponds to a program in an SPL. SPLs
                     and their feature models evolve over time. We classify the
                     evolution of a feature model via modifications as refactorings,
                     specializations, generalizations, or arbitrary edits. We

                     to help designers determine how the program membership
                     of an SPL has changed. Our algorithm takes two feature
                     models as input (before and after edit versions), where the
                     set of features in both models are not necessarily the same,
                     and it automatically computes the change classification. Our

                   <blockquote><p>
          Building software product lines (SPLs) with features is a challenging
          task. Many SPL implementations support features with coarse
          granularity - e.g., the ability to add and wrap entire methods. However,
          fine-grained extensions, like adding a statement in the middle
          of a method, either require intricate workarounds or obfuscate the
          base code with annotations. Though many SPLs can and have been
          implemented with the coarse granularity of existing approaches,
          fine-grained extensions are essential when extracting features from
          legacy applications. Furthermore, also some existing SPLs could
          benefit from fine-grained extensions to reduce code replication or
          improve readability. In this paper, we analyze the effects of feature
          granularity in SPLs and present a tool, called Colored IDE (CIDE),
          that allows features to implement coarse-grained and fine-grained
          extensions in a concise way. In two case studies, we show how CIDE
          simplifies SPL development compared to traditional approaches.</p></blockquote>

               studies suggest that aspects are well-suited for implementing
               features. We evaluate the suitability of AspectJ with respect
               to this task by a case study that refactors the embedded
               database system Berkeley DB into 38 features. Contrary to
               our initial expectations, the results were not encouraging.
               As the number of aspects in a feature grows, there is a noticeable
