<b>Announcements:</b> 
  <li>12/4: <a href="./lectureNotes/l19.pdf"><i>Final lecture slides</i></a>: Today's lecture will be on some research of my students and me which leverages some of the tools that we've seen during class.
 <li>12/2: Today's lecture will be on "Expander Codes".  We'll spend the first half discussing expander graphs (sparse graphs that behave like dense ones in the sense that they are well-connected), and the second half discussing how to use expander graphs to make good error-correcting codes.
  <li>11/16: <a href="./lectureNotes/l17.pdf"><i>Lecture 17 notes</i></a>: The Martingale Stopping Theorem (aka the Optional Stopping Theorem). [This material will be covered monday, and the last question on ps8 will require this material---just a direct application of Theorem 1---so I wanted to post the notes early.]
  <li>11/13: <a href="./lectureNotes/l16.pdf"><i>Lecture 16 notes</i></a>: Martingales, the Doob Martingale, and Azuma-Hoeffding Tail Bounds.
 <li>11/12: <a href="./midterm_2017.pdf"><i>Midterm exam from 2017</i></a>: This was very hard, (and I used some of these problems on this year's psets) but grades were curved generously.  Here are solutions: <a href="./midterm_2017_sols.pdf"><i>2017 solutions</i></a>.
 <li>11/12: I'll hold a special midterm/final prep office hour Tuesday (11/19), 5-7pm (in my office or in the room across the hall from my office).  I'll be happy to go through the practice midterms, or talk about any of the concepts we've covered.  I will *NOT* discuss problems from Problem Set 8 at this office hour (unless/until everyone's midterm/final questions have already been answered).
 <li>11/11: <a href="./midterm_2018.pdf"><i>Last year's midterm exam</i></a>: This was quite a hard exam, and I really liked question 3...maybe a bit too much.  The material on last year's exam did not include Markov chains and Martingales, which your exam will cover.  [Last year they also had a take-home final...]

<li>11/10: We will be having the in-class "final" exam on Wednesday, November 20th.  The exam will during our normal class time, and we will likely split between our current classroom and the one across the breezeway (waiting to confirm that).  The exam will be closed books/laptop, though you will be allowed to bring one double-sided page of notes, that you must have prepared yourself.  I will post some midterm exams from previous years, though those exams only cover the material through October.

<b>Course description:</B>

Randomness pervades the natural processes around us, from the formation of networks, to genetic recombination, to quantum physics. Randomness is also a powerful tool that can be leveraged to create algorithms and data structures which, in many cases, are more efficient and simpler than their deterministic counterparts. This course covers the key tools of probabilistic analysis, and applications of these tools to understand the behaviors of random processes and algorithms. Emphasis is on theoretical foundations, though we will apply this theory broadly, discussing applications in machine learning and data analysis, networking, and systems. 


<p>

<b>Topics:</B> Markov and Chebyshev inequalities, Chernoff bounds, random graphs, and expanders, moment generating functions, metric embeddings, the probabilistic method, Lovasz Local Lemma, Markov chains and random walks, MCMC, martingales, stopping times, Azuma-Hoeffding inequality, and many powerful and elegant randomized algorithms whose analyses rely on the above tools.

<p>

<b>Prerequisites:</B> CS 161 and STAT 116, or equivalents and instructor consent.

<p>

<b>Grading:</B> 65% problem sets, 35% in-class exam.
<p>
<b>Problem Set Policies:</B> Late problem sets will not be accepted, though your TWO lowest problem set scores will be dropped.  We strongly encourage using LaTex to typeset your problem sets, and have a LaTex <a href="template.tex"><i>template</i></a> that you may use.   We will be using the <a href="https://gradescope.com"><i>Gradescope</i></a> online submission system.  You should receive an email saying that you've been enrolled in CS265/CME309 from Gradescope. If not, create an account on Gradescope using your Stanford ID and join CS265/CME309 using entry code <b>92EK55</b>.<br> <br>

You are encouraged to find a partner, and hand in 1 problem set with both names.  As always, collaboration and discussion of the problems is encouraged, though you must understand everything that you hand in, and the writeup that your partner and you hand in must be your own group's writing.

<b> Lecture 9 (10/23):</b> Metric embeddings continued, Johnson-Lindenstrauss [JL] dimension reduction, and high level discussion of "Fast Johnson-Lindenstrauss" transform. Lecture notes <a href="JL_inprogress.pdf">here</a> contain proof of JL and discussion of locality sensitive hashing (an application of JL).  We didn't cover the Fast JL in much detail, and I havent added it to the notes yet: the original paper is <a href="https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~chazelle/pubs/FJLT-sicomp09.pdf">here</a>, and a higher level more concise treatment is <a href="https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2010/2/69359-faster-dimension-reduction/fulltext">here</a>.
