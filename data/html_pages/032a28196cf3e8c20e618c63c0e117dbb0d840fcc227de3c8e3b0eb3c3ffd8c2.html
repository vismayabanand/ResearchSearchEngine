                        <p><b>Keywords:</b> Privacy, Security, Requirements and Software Engineering;
                            Risk and Legal Compliance</p>

<p>Dr. Breaux is the Director of the CMU Requirements Engineering Lab, where his research program investigates how to specify and design software to comply with policy and law in a trustworthy, reliable manner. His work historically concerned the empirical extraction of legal requirements from policies and law, and has recently studied how to use formal specifications to reason about privacy policy compliance, how to measure and reason over ambiguous and vague policies, and how security and privacy experts and novices estimate the risk of system designs.</p>

<!--
                        How do we ensure that information systems comply with policies, laws and social norms?
                            
                            </p>
                            <p>As computers and information sharing increasingly pervade our 
                            everyday lives, we need greater assurance that software <i>can</i>
                            and <i>will</i> conform to our social and personal expectations. Policies and law
                        serve to document expectations among multiple parties and we can use these artifacts as a blueprint to discover software requirements. This is especially true in privacy, where corporate privacy policies and privacy regulations govern a range of software applications. To improve software quality and reliability, my
                            research addresses the challenges to aligning regulations and 
                            policies with software specifications. This includes studying:

                                <li style="padding-bottom: 6px">Formal languages to express policies and system requirements, and tools to reason about conflicts, inconsistencies and ambiguities within and among policies and software specifications;</li>

                                <li style="padding-bottom: 6px">Methods to enable requirements engineers, business analysts and software developers to analyze and refine policy into measurable system specifications that can be monitored over time; and</li>
                                
                                <li>Communities of practice that include diverse backgrounds, viewpoints and expertise, including law, computer science, government, industry and the public.</li>
