<h2>How We Share Personal Data</h2>
<p>It is the practice of CMU to protect users&#8217; information. Access to our users&#8217; information is restricted to only those employees or agents, contractors or subcontractors of CMU who have valid reasons to access this information to perform any service you have requested or authorized, or for any other purpose described in this Privacy Notice. The information you provide will not be sold or rented to third parties.</p>
<p>We may provide your personal data to:</p>
<ul>
<li>outsourced service providers who perform functions on our behalf, located inside or outside of the European Union (<strong>&#8220;EU&#8221;</strong>) territory (in such case, we will use the appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers). For example, your personal information may be stored on cloud hosting services such as Amazon Web Services.</li>
<li>our authorized agents and representatives, located inside or outside of your country of residence (in such case, we will use appropriate legal framework to operate data transfers), who provide services on our behalf, such as training service providers;</li>
<li>anyone expressly authorized by you to receive your personal data; or</li>
<li>anyone to whom we are required by law to disclose personal data, upon valid and enforceable request thereof.</li>
</ul>
<p>We will access, disclose and preserve personal data, when we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to:</p>
<ul>
<li>comply with applicable law or respond to valid legal processes, including from law enforcement or other government agencies, upon valid and enforceable request thereof; or</li>
<li>operate and maintain the security of the Services, including to prevent or stop an attack on our computer systems or networks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that some of the Services may direct you to services of third parties whose privacy practices differ from CMU&#8217;s. If you provide personal data to any of those services, your data is governed by their privacy statements or policies. Carnegie Mellon University is not responsible for the privacy practices of these other websites. Please review the privacy policies for these websites to understand how they process your information.</p>
<h2><strong>How You May Share Personal Data</strong></h2>
<p>Certain features of the Services may allow you to share information with others. Please do not share your personal data or the personal data of others through the sharing features. You are the controller of personal information you share through the sharing features of the Services.</p>
<h2>Handling of Personal Data</h2>
<p><em>Security of Personal Data</em></p>
<p>CMU is committed to protecting the security of your personal data. Depending on the circumstances, we may hold your information in hard copy and/or electronic form. For each medium, we use technologies and procedures to protect personal data. We review our strategies and update as necessary to meet our business needs, changes in technology, and regulatory requirements.</p>
<p>These measures include, but are not limited to, technical and organizational security policies and procedures, security controls and employee training.</p>
<p>We may suspend your use of all or part of the Services without notice if we suspect or detect any breach of security, abuse, or illegal or questionable activity. If you believe that information you provided to us is no longer secure, please notify us immediately using the contact information provided below.</p>
<p>If we become aware of a breach that affects the security of your personal data, we will provide you with notice as required by applicable law. To the extent permitted by applicable law, CMU will provide any such notice that CMU must provide to you at your account&#8217;s email address. By using the Services, you agree to accept notice electronically.</p>
<p><em>Storage and Transfer of Personal Data</em></p>
<p>Personal data collected by CMU may be stored and processed in your region, in the United States or in any other country where CMU, its affiliates or contractors maintain facilities, including outside the EU. We take steps to ensure that the data we collect under this Privacy Notice is processed pursuant to the terms thereof and the requirements of applicable law wherever the data is located.</p>
<p>CMU also collaborates with third parties such as cloud-hosting services and suppliers located around the world to serve the needs of our business, workforce, and users. In some cases, we may need to disclose or transfer your personal data within CMU or to third parties in areas outside of your home country. When we do so, we take steps to ensure that personal data is processed, secured, and transferred according to applicable law.</p>
<p>If you would like to know more about our data transfer practices, please contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<p><em>Retention of Personal Data</em></p>
<p>CMU retains personal data in a form which permits identification of data subjects for as long as necessary to provide the Services and fulfill the transactions you have requested, or for other business purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes, and enforcing our agreements. We are required by law to keep some types of information for certain periods of time (e.g., statute of limitations).</p>
<h2>Your Rights Regarding Your Personal Data</h2>
<p>CMU respects your right to access and control your personal data. You have choices about the data we collect. When you are asked to provide personal data that is not necessary for the purposes of providing you with the Services, you may decline. However, if you choose not to provide data that is necessary to provide the Services, you may not have access to certain features of the Services.</p>
<p>We aim to keep all personal data that we hold accurate, complete and up-to-date. While we will use our best efforts to do so, we encourage you to tell us if you change your contact details. If you believe that the information we hold about you is incorrect, incomplete or out-of-date, please contact <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Access to personal data.</strong> In some jurisdictions, you have the right to request access to your personal data. In these cases, we will comply, subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures. Before providing data to you, we will ask for proof of identity and sufficient information about your interaction with us so that we can locate any relevant data. We may also charge you a fee for providing you with a copy of your data (except where this is not permissible under local law).</p>
<p><strong>Correction and deletion. </strong>In some jurisdictions, you have the right to correct or amend your personal data if it is inaccurate or requires updating. You may also have the right to request deletion of your personal data. Please note that such a request could be refused because your personal data is required to provide you with the Services you requested, e.g., to send an invoice to your email address, or that it is required by the applicable law.</p>
<p><strong>Portability.</strong> If you reside within the EU, you have the right to ask for a copy of your personal data and/or ask for it to be ported to another provider of your choice. Please note that such a request could be limited to only personal data you provided us with or that we hold at that given time and subject to any relevant legal requirements and exemptions, including identity verification procedures.</p>
<p><strong>Marketing preferences.</strong> If you have provided us with your contact information, we may, subject to any applicable Spam Act or similar regulation, contact you via e-mail, postal mail or telephone about CMU Services and events that may be of interest to you, including our newsletter.</p>
<p>Marketing e-mail communications you receive from CMU will generally provide an unsubscribe link or instructions on how to opt-out of receiving future e-mail or to change your contact preferences. E-mail communications may also include a link to directly update and manage your marketing preferences. You can also request changes to your contact preferences by contacting CMU via email at <a href="mailto:it-help@cmu.edu">it-help@cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Please remember that even if you opt out of receiving marketing emails, we may still send you important Services information related to your accounts and subscriptions.</p>
<p><em>California Shine the Light Law:</em> California Civil Code Section 1798.83 permits users who are California residents to obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of third parties to whom we have disclosed personal information (if any) for direct marketing purposes in the preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and you wish to make such a request, please send an e-mail with &#8220;California Privacy Rights&#8221; in the subject line to <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a> or write us at: Carnegie Mellon University, Attention: Data Protection Officer.</p>

<p>To enhance our content and to deliver a better online experience for our users, we sometimes embed images and videos from other websites on the Services. We currently use, and may in future use content from services such as Facebook, LinkedIn and Twitter. You may be presented with Cookies from these third-party websites. Please note that we do not control these Cookies. The privacy practices of these third parties will be governed by the parties&#8217; own privacy statements or policies. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties, using Cookies or other means. You should consult and review the relevant third-party privacy statement or policy for information on how these Cookies are used and how you can control them.</p>
<p>We also use Google, a third-party analytics provider, to collect information about Services usage and the users of the Services, including demographic and interest-level information. Google uses Cookies in order to collect demographic and interest-level information and usage information from users that visit the Services, including information about the pages where users enter and exit the Services and what pages users view on the Services, time spent, browser, operating system, and IP address. Cookies allow Google to recognize a user when a user visits the Services and when the user visits other websites. Google uses the information it collects from the Services and other websites to share with us and other website operators&#8217; information about users including age range, gender, geographic regions, general interests, and details about devices used to visit websites and purchase items. We do not link information we receive from Google with any of your personally identifiable information. For more information regarding Google&#8217;s use of Cookies, and collection and use of information, see the Google Privacy Notice (available at <a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en</a>).

<p><em>How to Control and Delete Cookies</em></p>
<p>Cookies can be controlled, blocked or restricted through your web browser settings. Information on how to do this can be found within the Help section of your browser. All Cookies are browser specific. Therefore, if you use multiple browsers or devices to access websites, you will need to manage your cookie preferences across these environments.</p>
<p>If you are using a mobile device to access the Services, you will need to refer to your instruction manual or other help/settings resource to find out how you can control Cookies on your device.</p>
<p>Please note: If you restrict, disable or block any or all Cookies from your web browser or mobile or other device, the Services may not operate properly, and you may not have access to the Services. CMU shall not be liable for any impossibility to use the Services or degraded functioning thereof, where such are caused by your settings and choices regarding Cookies.</p>

<p><em>Social Sharing</em></p>
<p>We also embed social sharing icons throughout the Services. These sharing options are designed to enable users to easily share content from the Services with their friends using a variety of different social networks. If you choose to connect using a social networking or similar service, we may receive and store authentication information from that service to enable you to log in and other information that you may choose to share when you connect with these services. These services may collect information such as the web pages you visited and IP addresses, and may set cookies to enable features to function properly. We are not responsible for the security or privacy of any information collected by these third parties. You should review the privacy statements or policies applicable to the third-party services you connect to, use, or access. If you do not want your personal data shared with your social media account provider or other users of the social media service, please do not connect your social media account with your account for the Services and do not participate in social sharing on the Services.</p>
<p><em>Do Not Track </em></p>
<p>Some web browsers (including Safari, Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome) incorporate a &#8220;Do Not Track&#8221; (<strong>&#8220;DNT&#8221;</strong>) or similar feature that signals to websites that a user does not want to have his or her online activity and behavior tracked. If a website that responds to a particular DNT signal receives the DNT signal, the browser can block that website from collecting certain information about the browser&#8217;s user. Not all browsers offer a DNT option and DNT signals are not yet uniform. For this reason, many website operators, including CMU, do not respond to DNT signals.</p>
<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
<p>Certain Services are intended to be used by individuals who are under the age of 13 years old (<strong>&#8220;Children&#8221;</strong> or <strong>&#8220;Child&#8221;</strong>). Services directed to Children require verifiable parental consent and acknowledgement of the CMU <a href="coppa-notice.html">Children&#8217;s Online Privacy Protection Act (&#8220;COPPA&#8221;) Notice</a> prior to a Child&#8217;s participation. Consistent with the requirements of the COPPA, if we learn that we received any information directly from a Child without his or her parent&#8217;s verified consent, we will use that information only to inform the Child (or his or her parent or legal guardian) that he or she cannot use the Services.</p>
<p><em>California Minors:</em> If you are a California resident who is under age 18 and you are unable to remove publicly-available content that you have submitted to us, you may request removal by contacting us at: GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu. When requesting removal, you must be specific about the information you want removed and provide us with specific information, such as the URL for each page where the information was entered, so that we can find it. We are not required to remove any content or information that: (1) federal or state law requires us or a third party to maintain; (2) was not posted by you; (3) is anonymized so that you cannot be identified; (4) you don&#8217;t follow our instructions for removing or requesting removal; or (5) you received compensation or other consideration for providing the content or information. Removal of your content or information from the Services does not ensure complete or comprehensive removal of that content or information from our systems or the systems of our service providers. We are not required to delete the content or information posted by you; our obligations under California law are satisfied so long as we anonymize the content or information or render it invisible to other users and the public.</p>
<h2>The General Data Protection Regulation (&#8220;GDPR&#8221;)</h2>
<p>If you reside within the EU you may be entitled to other rights under the GDPR. These rights are summarized below. We may require you to verify your identity before we respond to your requests to exercise your rights. If you are entitled to these rights, you may exercise these rights with respect to your personal data that we collect and store:</p>
<ul>
<li>the right to withdraw your consent to data processing at any time (please note that this might prevent you from using certain aspects of the Services);</li>
<li>the right of access your personal data;</li>
<li>the right to request a copy of your personal data;</li>
<li>the right to correct any inaccuracies in your personal data;</li>
<li>the right to erase your personal data;</li>
<li>the right to data portability, meaning to request a transfer of your personal data from us to any other person or entity as chosen by you;</li>
<li>the right to request restriction of the processing of your personal data; and</li>
<li>the right to object to processing of your personal data.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may exercise these rights free of charge. These rights will be exercisable subject to limitations as provided for by the GDPR. Any requests to exercise the above-listed rights may be made to: <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<p>If you reside within the EU, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a Data Protection Authority about how we process your personal data at the following website: <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en" rel="noopener" target="_blank">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p>
<p><em>Processing EU Personal Data</em></p>
<p>In the event that your personal data is subject to the GDPR, we will only use your personal data for the original purpose for which we collected it, unless we reasonably consider that we need to use it for another purpose and that purpose is compatible with the original purpose. If we need to use your EU personal data for an unrelated purpose, we will notify you and we will explain the legal basis, which allows us to do so. We require third parties to only use your EU personal data for the specific purpose for which it was given to us and to protect the privacy of your personal data. If your personal data is no longer necessary for the legal or business purposes for which it is processed, we will generally destroy or anonymize that data.</p>
<p><em>International Transfers of Personal Data</em></p>
<p>Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EU, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>European Commission Standard Contractual Clauses: We may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission, which give personal data the same protection it has in the EU.</li>
<li>Privacy Shield. Where we use providers based in the U.S., we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield, which requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the U.S.</li>
</ul>
<p>For additional information on the mechanisms used to protect your personal data, please contact our Data Protection Officer at <a href="mailto:GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu">GDPR-info@andrew.cmu.edu</a>.</p>
<h2>Changes To This Privacy Notice</h2>
<p>We may update this Privacy Notice based upon evolving Laws, regulations and industry standards, or as we may make changes to our business including the Services. We will post changes to our Privacy Notice on this page and encourage you to review our Privacy Notice when you use the Services to stay informed. If we make changes that materially alter your privacy rights, CMU will provide additional notice, such as via email or through the Services. If you disagree with the changes to this Privacy Notice, you should discontinue your use of the Services. You may also request access and control of your personal data as outlined in the Your Rights Regarding Personal Data section of this Privacy Notice.</p>
