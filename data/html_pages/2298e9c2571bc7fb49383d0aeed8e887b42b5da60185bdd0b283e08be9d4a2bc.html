      Open Rank Faculty Position in Mechanical Engineering
    </div>
    <div class="article-body">
      The Department of Mechanical Engineering (ME) in the Bourns College of Engineering (BCOE) at the University of California, Riverside (UCR) invites applications as part of our ongoing efforts to build upon UCR’s strengths and foster innovative new cross-disciplinary initiatives, both within and outside of BCOE (e.g., with UCR’s School of Medicine, or the College of Natural &amp; Agricultural Sciences). Preference will be given to candidates with expertise in the areas of Dynamics, Structures, Design, &amp;/or Manufacturing, and the application thereof to Robotics, Transportation, Biomedicine, &amp;/or Energy. Exceptional applicants in other areas of Mechanical Engineering may also be considered. Successful candidates will receive a primary appointment within ME; however, opportunities may exist for additional affiliations with other departments and programs at UCR.

The Marlan and Rosemary Bourns College of Engineering is a well-established, rapidly growing college at UCR. Ranked in the top 50 best public research universities for engineering by U.S. News &amp; World Report, BCOE has over 140 faculty members, more than 3,700 undergraduate students, 1,100 graduate students, and more than $44 million in total annual research expenditures. The college has five departments, 11 undergraduate degree programs, 10 graduate degree programs, and 11 research centers.

Successful candidates will have a proven record of, or exceptional promise for, developing a vibrant externally-funded research program and developing a portfolio of high-quality teaching at the undergraduate and graduate levels. UC Faculty are expected to maintain an active research agenda and record of publications; teach a regular course load at both the undergraduate and graduate levels; and participate in service activities at the department, college, campus, and professional levels. Candidates should also demonstrate clear potential for complementing and/or synergistically leveraging existing research activities within the department, college, and campus.

Appointments are expected to begin on July 1, 2025. Salary will be commensurate with education and experience. Candidates must have met the requirements for the Ph.D. by the time of appointment. Advancement through the faculty ranks at the University of California is through a series of structured, merit-based evaluations, occurring every 2-3 years, each of which includes substantial peer input.

The posted UC salary scales set the minimum pay determined by rank and/or step at appointment. See Table(s) 3 at  https://www.ucop.edu/academic-personnel-programs/_files/2024-25/oct-2024-scales/t3.pdf . The salary range for this position is $103,700 -  $224,900. “Off-scale salaries” and other components of pay, i.e., a salary that is higher than the published system-wide salary at the designated rank and step, are offered when necessary to meet competitive conditions. See campus compensation page for additional information at https://academicpersonnel.ucr.edu/compensation

To apply for the position interested individuals are required to submit a cover letter, a curriculum vitae, three letters of reference or contact information for three references, a Statement of Research, a Statement of Teaching, and a Contribution to Diversity Statement to the AP Recruit website at https://aprecruit.ucr.edu/JPF01651. Inquiries should be directed to mesearch@engr.ucr.edu.

Priority will be given to applications received by November 8, 2024; however, subsequent applications may be reviewed until the positions are filled. Inquiries should be directed to mesearch@engr.ucr.edu. For more information regarding the specific areas of interest and application procedures, please visit  http://www.engr.ucr.edu/hireme.
