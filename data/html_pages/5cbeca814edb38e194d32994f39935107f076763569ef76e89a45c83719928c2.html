<p>Carnegie Mellon University established the first academic department in the United States dedicated to robotics when it created the Robotics Institute in 1979. Since then, it has been a world leader in robotics research and graduate education. Now, starting in the Fall of 2023, it is proud to offer an undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Robotics (BSR).<br/>
BSR teaches students how to create, program, and use robotics to solve real world problems. It is an interdisciplinary program taught from the computer science perspective. Students will master core concepts of computer science, mathematical foundations, and algorithmic concepts for robotics. Mechanics and electronics are covered in classes with an emphasis on their use in robotics applications and systems development. Students will acquire a broad knowledge of common robotics components, including software tools, mechanisms, and electronics. Students learn to work effectively in interdisciplinary teams through hands-on projects where they design, prototype, fabricate, and test robotic systems. The curriculum also includes discussions on ethical and societal impacts of robotics, and the development skills to communicate technical ideas to broad audiences.</p>
<p>Students in the B.S. program in Robotics are expected to acquire the following skills upon graduation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Understand how to use robotics to solve real-world problems, using techniques that include the integration of hardware and software components; designing, modeling, and controlling complex systems; reasoning about sensor data and actuator commands; and using these capabilities for decision making, action selection, and interaction with humans.</li>
	<li>Master the core concepts of computer science, with emphasis on programming, computing systems, and algorithm design.</li>
	<li>Master the mathematical fundamentals of robotics, including calculus, differential equations, representations of spatial relationships, linear algebra, signal processing, optimization methods, and probability theory.</li>
	<li>Master algorithmic concepts for robotics, including sensing and perception algorithms to model and extract information from real-world data; robotic manipulation algorithms to solve multi- axis motion control problems; planning algorithms that find successful paths and trajectories in the presence of obstacles and constraints; and the use of low-level control algorithms to abstract away complex dynamics.</li>
	<li>Acquire a broad knowledge of commonly used robotics components and tools, including various sensors, actuators, mechanical components, and software tools such as CAD, ROS, and Matlab; and understand how these components can be integrated into systems to enable effective and safe operation.</li>
	<li>Gain hands-on knowledge of prototyping design, fabrication, and testing skills for all aspects of robotics systems, including mechanical, electrical, communication, and computing systems.</li>
	<li>Develop the ability to form, manage, and work effectively in interdisciplinary teams using systems thinking, including using block diagrams to decompose complex systems into functional subsystems; working with potential stakeholders to define system requirements; identifying required skillsets to implement subsystems components and creating a suitable team; and assigning and managing task execution and systems integration.</li>
	<li>Understand the ethical and societal implications of robotics and artificial intelligence and be able to critically evaluate the impact of these technologies on society.</li>
	<li>Develop effective communication and presentation skills, including the ability to communicate complex technical concepts to a broad range of audiences.</li>
</ul>

<h4><strong>SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING</strong></h4>
<p>All candidates for the bachelor's degree in Robotics must complete a minimum of 36 units offered by the Mellon College of Science and/or the College of Engineering (CIT). These courses offer students an opportunity to explore scientific and engineering domains that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.</p>
<p>Requirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#genedtext" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a>.</p>
<h4>HUMANITIES AND ARTS</h4>
<p>All candidates for the bachelor's degree in Robotics must complete a minimum of 63 units offered by the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and/or the College of Fine Arts. Some courses from the Tepper School of Business also qualify for this requirement. These courses offer students breadth in their education and perspectives and provide students with a better appreciation of social, artistic, cultural, political and economic issues that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.</p>
<p>Requirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#genedtext" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a>.</p>
<p><strong>COMPUTING @ CARNEGIE MELLON (1 COURSE)</strong></p>
<p>The following course is required of all students to familiarize them with the campus computing environment:</p>

</tbody></table>

<h4>FREE ELECTIVES</h4>
<p>A free elective is any Carnegie Mellon course. However, a maximum of nine (9) units of Physical Education and/or Military Science (ROTC) and/or Student-Led (StuCo) courses may be used toward fulfilling graduation requirements.</p>
<h4><strong>Double Counting</strong></h4>
<p>In general, courses taken in satisfaction of the minor or additional major may also count toward any general education category in the Robotics major (i.e. courses outside of those listed in the Mathematics, Computer Science Core and Robotics Core requirements). Double counting toward Mathematics, Computer Science Core or Robotics Core courses in the Robotics major is strictly limited and depends on the chosen minor (or additional major). In general, students may double count at most five of the above listed requirements toward all other declared additional majors and minors. Additional majors and minors have their own double counting rules as well. Consult with an undergraduate advisor and an advisor from the department of the minor (or additional major) for specific restrictions on double counting.</p>
<h4>UNDERGRADUATE RESEARCH THESIS</h4>
<p>Robotics majors may use the SCS Honors Research Thesis as part of their degree. The <span class="sc_courseinline">SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis (<a class="bubblelink code" href="/search/?P=07-599" title="07-599">07-599</a>)</span> typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Up to 18 units can be counted toward SCS elective requirements (9 per semester for 2 semesters maximum).  Students interested in research may also consider using <span class="sc_courseinline"><a class="bubblelink code" href="/search/?P=07-300" title="07-300">07-300</a> Research and Innovation in Computer Science</span> in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science that may lead to a senior thesis. This course leads to a subsequent practicum that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use the practicum to start their senior thesis can use these units toward the required 36 units.</p>
<p>For more information about the SCS Honors Research Thesis, refer to the <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#scshonorsresearchthesistext">SCS Honors Research Thesis</a> section for learning objectives, application requirements and expected outcomes.</p>

Students with credit for two semesters of calculus may start with a more advanced math class (e.g. 21-241) in their first year. Students with no credit for introductory programming and/or one semester of calculus will take 15-112 and/or 21-120 in their first semester and shift a few courses to later semesters after consulting with their academic advisor; these students should still be able to complete their degree in four years. It is recommended that students keep their academic load lighter for their Senior Fall semester to account for offsite job interviews or for their Senior Spring semester to account for visits to graduate schools.</p>

*The flexibility in the curriculum allows many different schedules, of which the above is only one possibility. Some elective courses are offered only once per year (Fall or Spring). Constrained electives (probability, logic/languages, software systems, artificial intelligence and domains) may be taken in any order and in any semester if prerequisites are met and seats are available. Constrained electives are shown in the specific semesters in the schedule above as an example only. Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine the best elective options depending on course availability, their academic interests and their career goals. </p>

				<a name="roboticsadditionalmajortext"></a><p><strong>Robotics Program</strong></p>
<h2 headerid="1" name="roboticsadditionalmajortext">Robotics Additional Major</h2>
<p>Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University focuses on the theme that robotics is both multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary. This means that it draws from many fields, such as mechanical engineering, computer science and electrical engineering, and it also integrates these fields in a novel manner. The foundation of this program lies in motion and control. Upon this <span>base, sensing, cognition, and action are layered. Since robotics involves building artifacts that embody these fundamentals, foci, and systems thinking, there is a &quot;hands-on&quot; course requirement. These foci are brought together by a unique systems perspective special to robotics. Students will complete a capstone course that will tie together previously learned skills and knowledge.</span></p>
 <p><strong>Prerequisites</strong>: Successful candidates for the Robotics Additional major will have prerequisite knowledge of C language, basic programming skills, and familiarity with basic algorithms. Students can gain this knowledge by taking 15-122 Principles of Imperative Computation.</p> <hr/> <h5>Required Courses</h5> <p>There are 10 requirements below in total (one from each category plus two

The Minor is open to students in any major of any college at Carnegie Mellon. Students initially learn the basics of robotics in an introductory robotics overview course. Additional required courses teach control systems and robotic manipulation. Students also choose from a wide selection of electives in robotics, perception, computer vision, cognition and cognitive science, or computer graphics. Students have a unique opportunity to undertake independent research projects, working under the guidance of Robotics Institute faculty members; this provides an excellent introduction to robotics research for those considering graduate studies.</p> <p>All Robotics Minors are required to take 16-280 General Robotic Systems (if not offered substitute 16-311). This course is designed to help students understand the big picture of what is going on in robotics through topics such as kinematics, mechanisms, motion planning, sensor based planning, mobile robotics, sensors, and vision.  The minor also requires students to take a controls class and a kinematics class.  These courses provide students with the necessary intuition and technical background to move on to more advanced robotics courses. In addition to the required courses, students must take 2 electives. The student must have course selection approved by the Director during the application submission process. </p> <p>A 2.5 QPA in the Minor curriculum is required for graduation. Courses that are taken Pass/Fail or audited cannot be counted for the Minor.</p> <h5>Admission</h5> <p>Admission to the Undergraduate Minor in Robotics is limited to current Carnegie Mellon students.

<dt class="keepwithnext">16-161 ROB Seminar: Artificial Intelligence and Humanity</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.  As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.<br/>

We will use the legacy of societal conflict in Ireland and Northern Ireland to compare concepts and physical manifestations of borders, barriers and bridges in the region and in global contexts. We will examine fluctuating development of democratic processes in Ireland and Northern Ireland, individual and group public performance, and the influence of technologically crude and highly sophisticated tools on communities emerging from strife. We will use our analytical lens to focus on figurative and literal borders, barriers and bridges to explore work produced in Belfast, Derry and Dublin, alongside circumstances and artistic practice in present-day Pittsburgh, Cuidad Juarez, Jerusalem and Soweto.   On a visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland over spring break, students will meet with artists, writers, legislators, community organizers, academics and ex-combatants, to learn about their past experience and current motivations. Students will analyze artistic practice, peacekeeping initiatives and performance of identity in relation to the historical framework from which it emerges in Ireland and Northern Ireland. We will use this foundation as a point of comparison to practices throughout the world. Students will process their experience and developing analytical skills by documenting their responses through original creative work.<br/>

<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br/>OPEN TO GRADUATE AND UNDERGRADUATE STUDENTS; Autonomous Air Vehicles are finding new applications in Civil Air Transportation and Emergency Response scenarios. They carry passengers and valuable supplies and must be certified to operate in both urban and rural areas, close to people, buildings, highways, mountains, and dense forest canopies. This presents significant challenges to perception, control systems, and navigation through austere environments. The design limits and flight operations of the aircraft must be understood to be certified by the FAA. In Autonomous Air Vehicle Development, students will design, develop, and test prototype autonomous aircraft for specific missions defined by the new HeroX GoAero Challenge. This multidisciplinary course will go from concept to test and challenge students to apply sound theoretic approaches to a practical design. Students will learn how to design and build resilient autonomous air vehicle systems and the challenges of real-world design, operations, certification, and testing.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars.  The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel  and #8212; extracted from the &quot;big plan&quot; and #8212; is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.  These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.  Each student will either build their own business concept,  or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business.  Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.  In addition, he is the President of his own company Design One Software.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>People and animals move through and interact with the world in a fundamentally dynamic way. In the vast majority of cases the same cannot be said for robots. In fact, many conventional approaches to motion planning and robot control attempt to explicitly cancel out the dynamics associated with different tasks. This class will consider underactuated robots, systems that do not have full control over their state and therefore cannot be planned for or controlled via conventional methods. Our goal will be to make novel locomoting robots act more &quot;naturally.&quot; This class will highlight the relationship between conventional ideas from deterministic motion planning and control design (e.g., dynamic programming and linear-quadratic regulators) and their contemporary counterparts, many of which help form the analytical basis for the probabilisitic reasoning that underlies contemporary AI systems (e.g., POMDPs). Note that this course is inspired by and, for the most part, will follow the format of &quot;Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines&quot; created by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT.

We will explore suitable efficient probabilistic inference algorithms at the intersection of linear algebra and probabilistic graphical models. We will also explore state-of-the-art systems.<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">16-845 Insects and Robots</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>This course will cover all facets of modeling, design, fabrication, and analysis of robots operating on the insect scale, with a microrobotics perspective. Insects can perform different tasks, such as manipulation or locomotion, with their small scale bodies varying from 200m to 16cm length. Similarly, we can define a micro-robotic system as an autonomous or semi-autonomous device with features on the micron scale or that make use of micron-scale physics for mobility or manipulation of objects. Due to their small size scales, microrobots will encounter difficulties unlike their macro-scale counterparts, in terms of fabrication and autonomy. In this project-based course, our aim will be on learning the physics of scaling, fabrication paradigms, actuation and sensing strategies, with numerous case studies, and to build an insect-inspired robotic system. We will also discuss multiple applications such as surgical robotics, mobile microrobots, multi-agent systems, and micro/nano manipulation.<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">16-848 Hands: Design and Control for Dexterous Manipulation</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Research related to hands has increased dramatically over the past decade.  Robot hand innovation may be at an all time high, with new materials and manufacturing techniques promoting an explosion of ideas.   Hands have become a priority in virtual reality and telepresence.    Even the study of how people use their hands is seeing the growth of new ideas and themes.   With all of this attention on hands, are we close to a breakthrough in dexterity, or are we still missing some things needed for truly dexterous manipulation?    In this course, we will survey robotic hands and learn about the human hand with the goal of pushing the frontiers on hand design and control for dexterous manipulation. We will consider the necessary kinematics and dynamics for dexterity, what sensors are required to carry out dexterous interactions, the importance of reflexes and compliance, the role of machine learning in grasping and manipulation, and the challenge of uncertainty.  We will explore state of the art manufacturing and design techniques, including innovations in soft robotics and embedded sensing.  We will examine the human hand: its structure, sensing capabilities, human grasp choice and control strategies for inspiration and benchmarking. Students will be asked to present one or two research papers, participate in discussions and short research or design exercises, and carry out a final project.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Deep RL has a lot of promise to teach robots how to choose actions to optimize sequential decision-making problems, but how can we make deep RL work in the real world?  This is a seminar course in which we read papers related to deep learning for robotics and analyze the tradeoffs between different approaches. We will read mostly state-of-the-art papers that were very recently published (e.g. recent CoRL, RSS), but we will also look at some older papers that use different approaches. The goals of the course are to 1) understand what is needed to make deep learning work for robotics 2) analyze the tradeoffs between different approaches.  Each class, 2 papers will be presented. These papers will both achieve a similar robotics task but will use different learning-based approaches. The class will discuss these papers and try to understand the strengths and limitations of the approach described in each paper.

<dt class="keepwithnext">16-883 Special Topics: Provably Safe Robotics</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Safe autonomy has become increasingly critical in many application domains. It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot, but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the autonomy. For example, robots should be safe to human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly; autonomous vehicles should be safe to other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct functioning of all system components, i.e., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control. This course deals with both the design and the verification of safe robotic systems. From the design perspective, we will talk about how to assure safety through planning, prediction, learning, and control. From the verification perspective, we will talk about verification of deep neural networks, safety or reachability analysis for closed loop systems, and analysis of multi-agent systems.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>The goal of this course is to study relevant topics towards building intelligent robots that can learn to act and perceive in the real world. The course material should be a self-contained collection of key topics from the intersection of four research areas geared towards this common goal: a) Robot Learning  and amp; Deep RL; (b) Computer Vision; (c) Control; (d) Psychology  and amp; Neuroscience. This course is geared mainly towards learning and brainstorming. There will be two classes every week. In this first class, instructor will present an in-depth overview of a topic, and then in the second class, students will present instructor-assigned papers related to that topic. There will be no homeworks and just a course project.     In the first quarter, we will cover state-of-the-art topics in robot learning (deep RL, inverse RL, etc.) and control (optimal control, dynamic movement primitives, etc.) by studying classical and recent papers in the area. In the second quarter, we will study the role of perception in control and vice-versa to build methods that can learn from high-dimensional raw sensory input. In the third quarter, we will discuss the state of the current understanding of how the brain integrates action and perception. We will also discuss relevant papers from ontogeny (child development literature in Psychology) and phylogeny (evolutionary development literature in Biology) of biological animals that have inspired ideas in learning and robotics. Finally, in the fourth quarter, we will bring these ideas together to brainstorm potential high-level directions that could guide the development of intelligent robots.<br/>
