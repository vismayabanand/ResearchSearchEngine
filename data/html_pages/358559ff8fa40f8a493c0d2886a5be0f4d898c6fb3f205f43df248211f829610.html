<p>
The Student Research Forum provides
an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students attending SIGSOFT 2004 
to present and discuss
their research at poster sessions.  
<br>
This 2-hour evening event (held on Tuesday evening  will
feature concurrent short presentations by student participants
organized in poster formats.  Each student will be provided a 30" by 40"
board and an easel for the presentation.  SIGSOFT 2004 attendees, including
non-students, will be able to wander among the posters and talk to
the students about their research.   Light refreshments will be provided.
<p> 
Posters are an excellent forum for students to present their work in 
an informal and interactive session, and to
present late-breaking and preliminary results, or work-in-progress posters. 
Unlike other technical venues, posters are highly
visual and interactive, and they are intended to provide students and 
participants with the ability to engage in
deep technical discussions about their work. 
Posters provide students with a unique opportunity to make their
work highly visible during the conference, and to discuss their work 
one-on-one with other conference
participants. 
The goal is to develop a poster that encourages small
groups of individuals interested in a technical area to gather and interact, 
and the poster session will be
organized to facilitate such interactions. 
<p>

<b>Poster authors are required to attend the scheduled interactive poster 
session, staying with their poster so
that they can discuss their work with conference attendees. 
Poster authors are also required to register for the main conference.
</b>
Some poster authors also post an informal
schedule along with their poster, listing times when they plan to 
be available for discussion later on during the
conference. Others leave sign-up sheets for interested viewers to obtain further information. All posters will
have an associated "message board," on which viewers can post comments, ideas, and questions and on
which poster authors will be able to post responses, to further increase interactions and value for everyone.
<p>
Students who wish to present a poster display of their research must
send the following information to <b>Lori Pollock 
(pollock@cis.udel.edu)
by  August 1, 2004 (extended to August 10, 2004). 
</b>
<p>
        1. a title and 500 word abstract of their proposed presentation
<br>
        2. their email address, phone number and surface mail address
<br>
        3. name of their department and school
<br>
	4. name of their academic advisor 
<p>
Each prospective participant also is asked to have a short email note
of support of their participation from their faculty research advisor
sent to Professor Pollock.  Selected participants will be
<b>notified by August 20, 2004.</b>
<p>
If there is more interest in this program than can be accommodated,
each school will be asked to select its student presenter(s) on
the basis of the size of their annual Ph.D. class, with limited
representation from each Computer Science department.
