<p>The B.S. program in Computer Science combines a solid core of Computer Science courses with the ability to gain additional depth through a required minor in a second subject or a concentration in a computing area. In addition, the curriculum provides breadth through numerous choices for science, engineering, humanities and fine arts courses. As computing is a discipline with strong links to many fields, this provides students with unparalleled flexibility to pursue allied (or non-allied) interests. </p>
<p>Students apply to, and are directly admitted into, the School of Computer Science. Admitted students may choose to pursue an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and, upon successful completion, are awarded a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science. Suitably prepared students from other Carnegie Mellon colleges are eligible to apply for internal transfer to the School of Computer Science and will be considered for transfer if grades in core CS requirements are sufficiently high and space is available.</p>
<p>Students in the B.S. program in Computer Science are expected to acquire the following skills upon graduation:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Identify, use, design, develop and analyze appropriate abstractions and algorithms to solve problems while being able to prove the algorithm’s performance and correctness across a variety of metrics (e.g., time, space, parallel vs. sequential implementation, computability).</li>
	<li>Implement solutions to problems in domains such as artificial intelligence, graphics and sound, software engineering, and human-computer interaction, by applying the fundamentals of those areas to create solutions to current problems while being exposed to research developments that will enable them to adapt as the technology changes.</li>
	<li>Reason about and implement programs in various programming languages and paradigms</li>
	<li>Describe, specify, and develop large-scale, open-ended software systems subject to constraints such as performance and/or resource issues</li>
	<li>Communicate technical material effectively to technical and non-technical audiences</li>
	<li>Work both individually and in teams</li>
	<li>Recognize the social impact of computing and the attendant responsibility to consider the legal, moral and ethical implications of computing technologies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the tremendous number of ongoing research projects within the School, many students obtain part-time or summer jobs, or receive independent study credit, working on research while pursuing their undergraduate degree. Students seeking a research/graduate school career may pursue an intensive course of research, equivalent to four classroom courses, culminating in the preparation of a senior research thesis.</p>
<p>SCS also offers a B.S. degree in Artificial Intelligence, a B.S. degree in Computational Biology, a B.S. degree in Human-Computer Interaction, and a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and the Arts (jointly with the College of Fine Arts). More detail about the Artificial Intelligence major, the Computational Biology major and the Computer Science and the Arts program is available in separate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog. SCS offers additional majors in Computer Science (for non-CS majors), Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics, and minors in Computational Biology, Computer Science (for non-CS majors), Human-Computer Interaction, Language Technologies, Machine Learning, Neural Computation, Robotics, and Software Engineering. Information about additional majors and minors in SCS besides those in Computer Science are listed in a separate section in the Undergraduate Catalog.</p>

<h4>Science and Engineering</h4>
<p>All candidates for the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete a minimum of 36 units offered by the Mellon College of Science and/or the College of Engineering (CIT). These courses offer students an opportunity to explore scientific and engineering domains that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.</p>
<p>Requirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#genedtext" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a>.</p>
<h4>Humanities and Arts</h4>
<p>All candidates for the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete a minimum of 63 units offered by the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and/or the College of Fine Arts. Some courses from the Tepper School of Business also qualify for this requirement. These courses offer students breadth in their education and perspectives and provide students with a better appreciation of social, artistic, cultural, political and economic issues that can influence their effectiveness as computer scientists upon graduation.</p>
<p>Requirements for this component of the degree are listed under the SCS main page under <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#genedtext" target="_blank">General Education Requirements</a>.</p>
<h4>Required Minor or Concentration</h4>
<p>Students completing the bachelor's degree in Computer Science must complete either a minor outside of SCS or a concentration within SCS. A minor is a sequence of (typically 5-6) courses within a particular department to give students a core of a specific discipline but not an entire major of study. Refer to the sections for other CMU colleges for details about available non-SCS minors. An SCS concentration is a sequence of (typically 4-5) courses within an SCS department to give students further depth in specific areas of research important to SCS. SCS concentrations are available only to SCS students and assume that these students have a significant core knowledge in Computer Science including 15-210, 15-213 and 15-251. See the SCS Concentrations section for a list of available concentrations and their requirements. Completion of an additional major (or dual degree) also satisfies this requirement. Students should consult with their academic advisor to plan for their desired minor or concentration starting in the sophomore year.</p>
<p><strong>Double Counting</strong></p>
<p>In general, courses taken in satisfaction of the minor or additional major may also count toward any general education category in the CS major (i.e. courses outside of the Computer Science and Mathematics requirements). Double counting toward Computer Science and Mathematics courses in the CS major is strictly limited and depends on the chosen minor (or additional major). In general, students may double count at most 5 of the 12 core Computer Science requirements toward all other declared additional majors and minors. Additional majors and minors have their own double counting rules as well. Consult with a CS undergraduate advisor and an advisor from the department of the minor (or additional major) for specific restrictions on double counting.</p>
<h4>Computing @ Carnegie Mellon (1 course)</h4>
<p>The following course is required of all students to familiarize them with the campus computing environment:</p>

</tbody></table>

<h4>Free Electives</h4>
<p>A free elective is any Carnegie Mellon course. However, a maximum of nine (9) units of Physical Education and/or Military Science (ROTC) and/or Student-Led (StuCo) courses may be used toward fulfilling graduation requirements.</p>

<h3 headerid="1" name="bscurriculumtext">Sample Course Sequence</h3>
<p>The sample given below is for a student who already has credit for introductory programming and one semester of calculus. Students with credit for two semesters of calculus may start with a more advanced math class (e.g. 21-241) in their first year. Students with no credit for introductory programming and/or one semester of calculus will take 15-112 and/or 21-120 in their first semester and shift a few courses to later semesters after consulting with their academic advisor; these students should still be able to complete their degree in four years. It is recommended that students keep their academic load lighter for their Senior Fall semester to account for offsite job interviews or for their Senior Spring semester to account for visits to graduate schools.</p>

*The flexibility in the curriculum allows many different schedules, of which the above is only one possibility. Some elective courses are offered only once per year (Fall or Spring). Constrained electives (probability, logic/languages, software systems, artificial intelligence and domains) may be taken in any order and in any semester if prerequisites are met and seats are available. Constrained electives are shown in the specific semesters in the schedule above as an example only. Students should consult with their academic advisor to determine the best elective options depending on course availability, their academic interests and their career goals.  </p>
<h3 headerid="2" name="bscurriculumtext">Undergraduate Research Thesis</h3>
<p>CS majors may use the SCS Honors Research Thesis as part of their degree. The <span class="sc_courseinline">SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis (<a href="/search/?P=07-599" title="07-599" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-599');">07-599</a>)</span> typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Up to 18 units can be counted toward CS elective requirements (9 per semester for 2 semesters maximum).  Students interested in research may also consider using <span class="sc_courseinline">Research and Innovation in Computer Science (<a href="/search/?P=07-300" title="07-300" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-300');">07-300</a>, 9 units)</span> as their technical communications requirement in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science that may lead to a senior thesis. This course leads to a subsequent <span class="sc_courseinline">Research Practicum in Computer Science (<a href="/search/?P=07-400" title="07-400" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-400');">07-400</a>, 12 units)</span> that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use 15-400 to start their senior thesis can use these units toward the required 36 units.</p>

<p>For more information about the SCS Honors Research Thesis, refer to the <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/#scshonorsresearchthesistext">SCS Honors Research Thesis</a> section for learning objectives, application requirements and expected outcomes.</p>
<h3 headerid="3" name="bscurriculumtext"><span>Dual Degree in Computer Science</span></h3>
<p>Students wishing to pursue a Dual Degree in Computer Science are required to apply in the same way as students wishing to transfer into the Computer Science major. Details are given in the SCS Policies section. Besides the student's primary degree requirements, a student accepted for Dual Degree in CS is required to complete at least 450 units in total and meet all requirements for the CS major including all general education requirements (humanities/arts and science/engineering). Dual degree students do not need to complete <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=07-128" title="07-128" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-128');">07-128</a></span>, and these students will replace <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=15-151" title="15-151" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-151');">15-151</a></span> with either <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=21-127" title="21-127" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-127');">21-127</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=21-128" title="21-128" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-128');">21-128</a></span>. Since the CS major requires at least a minor or concentration in another area, the student's primary major will substitute for this requirement. Note that the primary major must be completed prior to or at the same time as the dual degree in CS to satisfy the minor requirement; a dual degree in CS cannot be certified if the primary degree is not completed. Students should consult with the Assistant Dean in the CS Undergraduate Office and/or their CS academic advisor to review all requirements, once approved.</p>

<h3 headerid="4" name="bscurriculumtext">Double-Counting Restriction</h3>
<p>Students pursuing a Dual Degree in Computer Science must complete all requirements for the CS primary major (except <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=07-128" title="07-128" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-128');">07-128</a></span> which is not required and <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=15-151" title="15-151" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-151');">15-151</a></span> which will be replaced with <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=21-127" title="21-127" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-127');">21-127</a></span> or <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=21-128" title="21-128" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-128');">21-128</a></span>). In addition, at most 5 of the 12 computer science requirements can double count with all other declared majors and minors. Students, especially from interdisciplinary majors or with multiple majors or minors, are urged to consult with the Assistant Dean or Undergraduate Program Coordinator in the CS Undergraduate Office to determine double-counting restrictions specific to their own situations.</p>

				<a name="csadditionalmajorminortext"></a><h2 headerid="5" name="csadditionalmajorminortext">Computer Science Additional Major</h2>
<p>Students interested in pursuing an additional major in Computer Science should first consult with the Program Coordinator in the CS Undergraduate Office. Students are expected to complete the requirements for the CS minor first before continuing on to the additional major. Completion of the CS additional major requires 12 computer science courses (not including <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=15-110" title="15-110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-110');">15-110</a></span><span> and </span><span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a></span><span> if needed),  5 mathematics courses, and 1 technical communication course. Students are expected to complete all courses for the additional major with an average QPA of 3.0 or higher.</span></p>

<p>Declaration for the additional major is allowed only after all math requirements are completed or in progress, and at least 9 of the 12 CS requirements (core and electives) are completed or in progress. Due to high demand, seats in upper-level CS courses are not guaranteed for additional majors so students should plan to be flexible in selecting constrained and general electives. Acceptance to complete a Computer Science additional major is not guaranteed and depends on student performance and seat availability.</p>

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-150 Principles of Functional Programming</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br/>An introduction to programming based on a &quot;functional&quot; model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs and #8212;-that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>What is knowable, in principle and in practice? - What does it mean to be intelligent? - Can creativity be automated? - What is the role of randomness in the universe? - How can we achieve provable guarantees of security, privacy, fairness, etc. in various settings? - What does the social network of the world look like? - Do we live in a simulation?  Despite their differences, all of these questions are fundamentally about the notion of computation. And all these questions can be put under the following single umbrella:  What is computation and how does it shape our understanding of life, science, technology, and society?  This course is for anyone interested in these questions and more broadly, anyone interested in the algorithmic lens to tackle hard, foundational problems. Our goal will be to find reliable explanations through modeling and rigorous reasoning. We will discuss great and powerful ideas from the field of theory of computation and see how these ideas shed new light on human reasoning, laws of nature, life, technology, and society.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-110" title="15-110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-110');">15-110</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-104" title="15-104" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-104');">15-104</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://computationallens.com" target="_blank">http://computationallens.com</a></dd>

<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br/>Symbolic logic is fundamental to computer science, providing a foundation for the theory of programming languages, database theory, AI, knowledge representation, automated reasoning, interactive theorem proving, and formal verification. Formal methods based on logic complement statistical methods and machine learning by providing rules of inference and means of representation with precise semantics. These methods are central to hardware and software verification, and have also been used to solve open problems in mathematics. This course will introduce students to logic on three levels: theory, implementation, and application. It will focus specifically on applications to automated reasoning and interactive theorem proving. We will present the underlying mathematical theory, and students will develop the mathematical skills that are needed to design and reason about logical systems in a rigorous way. We will also show students how to represent logical objects in a functional programming language, Lean, and how to implement fundamental logical algorithms. We will show students how to use contemporary automated reasoning tools, including SAT solvers, SMT solvers, and first-order theorem provers to solve challenging problems.

<dd>Fall and Spring: 15 units<br/>Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and &quot;team programming&quot; skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-412 Operating System Practicum</dt>
<dd>Fall<br/>The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build, install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.  Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a <a href="/search/?P=15-410" title="15-410" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-410');">15-410</a> student kernel.  In some situations students may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus 12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.  Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities such as: learning a revision control system, writing a short design document, creating and updating a simple project plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing scattered information about hardware and software, classifying and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people over a long period of time, etc.<br/>Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=15-410" title="15-410" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-410');">15-410</a></dd>

This course is a project-based course in which students conduct a semester-long project for a real client in small teams. The project defines real world needs for the client in their company. This is not a lecture-based course; after the first few weeks the course consists primarily of weekly team meetings with the course instructors, with teams making regular presentations on their software development process. Teams will give presentations and deliver documents on topics such as:          risk management          project planning          requirements          architecture          detailed design          quality assurance          final product presentations          reflections on the experience  Evaluation will be based on the in-class presentations, process and project documentation, how well the teams follow software engineering (SE) practices, and the client's satisfaction with the product. Individual grades will be influenced by peer reviews, individual reflection documents, mentor impressions, and presentation performance. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices, will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-455 Undergraduate Complexity Theory</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 9 units<br/>Complexity theory is the study of how much of a resource (such as time, space, parallelism, or randomness) is required to perform some of the computations that interest us the most. In a standard algorithms course, one concentrates on giving resource efficient methods to solve interesting problems. In this course, we concentrate on techniques that prove or suggest that there are no efficient methods to solve many important problems.  We will develop the theory of various complexity classes, such as P, NP, co-NP, PH, #P, PSPACE, NC, AC, L, NL, UP, RP, BPP, IP, and PCP. We will study techniques to classify problems according to our available taxonomy. By developing a subtle pattern of reductions between classes we will suggest an (as yet unproven!) picture of how by using limited amounts of various resources, we limit our computational power.<br/>Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=15-251" title="15-251" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-251');">15-251</a> Min. grade C<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course focuses on three-dimensional geometry processing, while simultaneously providing a first course in traditional differential geometry. Our main goal is to show how fundamental geometric concepts (like curvature) can be understood from complementary computational and mathematical points of view. This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and leads to the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way we will revisit important ideas from calculus and linear algebra, putting a strong emphasis on intuitive, visual understanding that complements the more traditional formal, algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples and applications. It also provides a short survey of recent developments in digital geometry processing and discrete differential geometry. Topics include: curves and surfaces, curvature, connections and parallel transport, exterior algebra, exterior calculus, Stokes' theorem, simplicial homology, de Rham cohomology, Helmholtz-Hodge decomposition, conformal mapping, finite element methods, and numerical linear algebra. Applications include: approximation of curvature, curve and surface smoothing, surface parameterization, vector field design, and computation of geodesic distance.<br/>Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=02-201" title="02-201" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '02-201');">02-201</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-110" title="15-110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-110');">15-110</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-122" title="15-122" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-122');">15-122</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-254" title="21-254" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-254');">21-254</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-242" title="21-242" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-242');">21-242</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-240" title="21-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-240');">21-240</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-241" title="21-241" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-241');">21-241</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-341" title="21-341" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-341');">21-341</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-259" title="21-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-259');">21-259</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-254" title="21-254" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-254');">21-254</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-269" title="21-269" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-269');">21-269</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-268" title="21-268" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-268');">21-268</a> Min. grade C)<br/>

Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera, by combining imaging and computation to enable new and enhanced ways of capturing, representing, and interacting with the physical world.  This advanced undergraduate course provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in computational photography. At the start of the course, we will study modern image processing pipelines, including those encountered on mobile phone and DSLR cameras, and advanced image and video editing algorithms. Then we will proceed to learn about the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as 3D scanning, coded photography, lightfield imaging, time-of-flight imaging, VR/AR displays, and computational light transport. Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue.  The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them. For their final projects, students will have the choice to use modern sensors provided by the instructors (lightfield cameras, time-of-flight cameras, depth sensors, structured light systems, etc.).  This course requires familarity with linear algebra, calculus, programming, and doing computations with images.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course will explore the future of robot toys by analyzing and programming Anki Cozmo, a new robot with built-in artificial intelligence algorithms. Como is distinguished from earlier consumer robots by its reliance on vision as the primary sensing mode and its sophisticated use of A.I. Its capabilities include face and object recognition, map building, path planning, and object pushing and stacking. Although marketed as a pre-programmed children's toy, Cozmo's open source Python SDK allows anyone to develop new software for it, which means it can also be used for robotics education and research. The course will cover robot software architecture, human-robot interaction, perception, and planning algorithms for navigation and manipulation.

<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br/>Computing has been dominated by von Neumann CPU architectures for seventy years. The von Neumann architecture is familiar and flexible, but it is also extremely inefficient, wasting upwards of 99% of energy. As computing is now energy-limited across all scales, from IoT to data center, von Neumann's inefficiency can no longer be tolerated. Recently, industry has adopted heterogeneous &quot;accelerator&quot; hardware to boost performance and efficiency. However, accelerators have limited programmability, sacrificing the main benefit of CPU architectures and putting future innovation at risk.
