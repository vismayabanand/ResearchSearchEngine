Through JGI’s Roots \u0026amp; Shoots program, she empowers young people to improve their communities through service projects, ensuring that they become better stewards of the environment than previous generations.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs a global activist traveling nearly 300 days a year, she has devoted her life to inspiring all people to take action to improve the well-being of people, other animals and the natural world we share.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Dr. Goodall’s focus on giving people, particularly young people, the knowledge and confidence to make an impact by being part of something bigger than themselves makes her an example to emulate,” said Patricia Turner, senior dean of the UCLA College. “She has moved beyond her role as a scientist to encourage all of us to become active partners in the future of our world.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eGoodall’s talk will be the fifth Luskin Lecture for Thought Leadership.

During the initiative, nearly 220,000 donors from all 50 U.S. states and 98 additional countries gave more than 574,000 gifts to advance causes across campus and in communities in Southern California and around the world.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eApproximately 95% of those gifts were less than $10,000, and 81% were less than $1,000, indicating the broad-based support for UCLA’s mission.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eUCLA also received transformative philanthropic commitments of more than $100 million, including Marion Anderson’s giving for students, faculty and facilities at the UCLA Anderson School of Management; David Geffen’s gifts for medical student scholarships and the Geffen Academy at UCLA; Meyer and Renee Luskin’s giving to name the school of public affairs and build a campus conference center; and Henry and Susan Samueli’s gifts to expand engineering education and research.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“As we celebrate UCLA’s first hundred years, the Centennial Campaign for UCLA has exceeded its goals and engaged students, faculty, friends and leaders in setting up the university for an even more remarkable second century,” UCLA Chancellor Gene Block said. “We are so grateful to each and every person who has participated in this extraordinary effort.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eCampaign gifts cross campus, causes and communities\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFunds raised through the campaign already are making a difference across the campus, including supporting students in a diverse range of fields.

William Schopf — in his 52nd year as a UCLA faculty member — has been on a quest. For decades, he and an international team of scientists have worked to fill a black hole of knowledge about Earth’s earliest history of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHis pursuit began in 1960, when Schopf — then an undergraduate at Oberlin College in Ohio — took an introductory historical geology course. He had been learning a great deal through his textbooks and professors about the most recent 500 million years of Earth’s history, but could find virtually nothing about the Earth’s first 4 billion years. His professor mentioned that the earliest history of life, now known to be at least 85% of life’s history, was unknown. Schopf decided that day this was a problem he could solve.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe recalls thinking that evolution was a fact, not a fable, so the missing record of life didn’t make sense. Schopf went to his dormitory and read his copy of Charles Darwin’s 1859 classic, “On the Origin of Species.” Darwin stated that there is no known evidence of life before the oldest animal fossils from roughly 500 million years ago, and considered this an inexplicable hole in his theory of evolution. Why was there a complete absence of any record of life more than 500 million years ago?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf said this enormous gap in knowledge was as if U.S. history began in the late 1960s and all earlier history had been wiped out — the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, George Washington, the Civil War, electricity, telephones, the Great Depression, two World Wars, the Atomic Age and so much more.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eDuring his college years, his father’s friends and other professionals tried to discourage Schopf from attempting to uncover life’s early fossil record, telling him there had been no meaningful progress for a century and that it was nearly certain he would fail. But he persisted and succeeded. He shares his remarkable story, spanning nearly 60 years, in his 2019 book, “Life in Deep Time: Darwin’s ‘Missing’ Fossil Record.” In it, he recounts the discoveries that reveal the earliest history of life.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf, director of UCLA’s Center for the Study of Evolution and the Origin of Life, and his colleagues have produced the most comprehensive information about life’s ancient history, from the formation of our planet 4.6 billion years ago to events half-a-billion years ago.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWhat significant events occurred in that first 85% of the Earth’s history? Among many other things, the first living organisms, the modern food chain, photosynthesis, the development of the atmosphere and oceans, and various types of cell division all date from this enormously long period of time.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe story of the Earth’s earliest history and the life it harbored is detailed in two books Schopf edited. “Earth’s Earliest Biosphere: Its Origin and Evolution,” published in 1983, spans the earliest 2 billion years of Earth’s history, and “The Proterozoic Biosphere: A Multidisciplinary Study,” published in 1992, focuses on the next 2 billion years. Some scientists have referred to these books as the Old Testament and the New Testament. Each received an award from the American Association of Publishers the year it was published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two books combined brought together 50 scientists from 30 universities in eight countries: the United States, Russia, Australia, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and South Africa. The interdisciplinary team of scientists included experts in such fields as geology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf and his colleagues collected and analyzed hundreds of ancient rocks from Australia, China, the United States, Europe, what was then the Soviet Union and elsewhere. They produced a vast ancient-fossil record that tells the history of the Earth’s first 4 billion years and changed our understanding of how evolution works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf joined UCLA’s faculty in 1968 at age 26, and was promoted to full professor five years later. In 1977, he received the National Science Foundation’s Alan T. Waterman Award as the outstanding young scientist in the nation. He has won seven medals from national and international scientific societies, and has been elected as a member of the country’s most prestigious scholarly honorific societies. He is a professor in UCLA’s department of Earth, planetary and space sciences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2002, Schopf and colleagues substantiated the biological origin of the earliest known cellular fossils, which are nearly 3.5 billion years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and colleagues presented a new analysis in 2017 of these 3.5-billion-year-old fossil microorganisms, which provided strong evidence to support the increasingly widespread understanding that \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ancient-fossil-microorganisms-indicate-that-life-in-the-universe-is-common\"\u003elife in the universe is likely common\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By 3.465 billion years ago, life was already diverse on Earth — that’s clear,” Schopf said in 2017. “This tells us life had to have begun substantially earlier and it confirms that it was not difficult for primitive life to form and to evolve into more advanced microorganisms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his 2019 book, he writes, “Clearly, primordial life evolved earlier, farther and faster than had ever been imagined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Schopf was part of an international team of scientists that discovered the \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/scientists-discover-organism-that-hasnt-evolved-in-more-than-2-billion-years\"\u003egreatest absence of evolution ever reported\u003c/a\u003e — deep-sea microorganisms that appear to have not evolved over more than 2 billion years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new book, he also writes about the NASA scientists who claimed in 1996 that they had found evidence of life on Mars in a meteorite that landed in Antarctica 13,000 years earlier. Schopf offers a behind-the-scenes look at the events leading to a NASA news conference that year that generated headlines worldwide. Schopf, who first assessed the evidence for life on Mars a year-and-a-half before the news conference, concluded, to put it charitably, that the evidence was inconclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want there to be life on Mars more than anyone else,” he had said, “but it doesn't matter what I want. The evidence isn’t there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at how the decades-long research on the Earth’s “missing” fossil record has changed our understanding of life on Earth, Schopf writes, “While this particular paradigm shift pales in comparison with Copernicus’ realization that the Earth flies around the sun, not the other way around, it too is fundamental, the root of two new fields of science, Precambrian paleobiology and astrobiology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt age 78, he continues to work seven days a week, searching for more answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003c/body\u003e\u003c/html\u003e","default_file":{"default_file:url":["https://s3.amazonaws.com/cms.ipressroom.com/173/files/20194/J.+William+Schopf+photo+I+in+UCLA+studio.jpg"],"default_file:title":["J.

Each received an award from the American Association of Publishers the year it was published.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe two books combined brought together 50 scientists from 30 universities in eight countries: the United States, Russia, Australia, Canada, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and South Africa. The interdisciplinary team of scientists included experts in such fields as geology, organic chemistry, biochemistry, molecular biology and microbiology.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf and his colleagues collected and analyzed hundreds of ancient rocks from Australia, China, the United States, Europe, what was then the Soviet Union and elsewhere. They produced a vast ancient-fossil record that tells the history of the Earth’s first 4 billion years and changed our understanding of how evolution works.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eSchopf joined UCLA’s faculty in 1968 at age 26, and was promoted to full professor five years later. In 1977, he received the National Science Foundation’s Alan T. Waterman Award as the outstanding young scientist in the nation. He has won seven medals from national and international scientific societies, and has been elected as a member of the country’s most prestigious scholarly honorific societies. He is a professor in UCLA’s department of Earth, planetary and space sciences.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2002, Schopf and colleagues substantiated the biological origin of the earliest known cellular fossils, which are nearly 3.5 billion years old.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eHe and colleagues presented a new analysis in 2017 of these 3.5-billion-year-old fossil microorganisms, which provided strong evidence to support the increasingly widespread understanding that \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/ancient-fossil-microorganisms-indicate-that-life-in-the-universe-is-common\"\u003elife in the universe is likely common\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“By 3.465 billion years ago, life was already diverse on Earth — that’s clear,” Schopf said in 2017. “This tells us life had to have begun substantially earlier and it confirms that it was not difficult for primitive life to form and to evolve into more advanced microorganisms.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn his 2019 book, he writes, “Clearly, primordial life evolved earlier, farther and faster than had ever been imagined.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn 2015, Schopf was part of an international team of scientists that discovered the \u003ca href=\"https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/scientists-discover-organism-that-hasnt-evolved-in-more-than-2-billion-years\"\u003egreatest absence of evolution ever reported\u003c/a\u003e — deep-sea microorganisms that appear to have not evolved over more than 2 billion years.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the new book, he also writes about the NASA scientists who claimed in 1996 that they had found evidence of life on Mars in a meteorite that landed in Antarctica 13,000 years earlier. Schopf offers a behind-the-scenes look at the events leading to a NASA news conference that year that generated headlines worldwide. Schopf, who first assessed the evidence for life on Mars a year-and-a-half before the news conference, concluded, to put it charitably, that the evidence was inconclusive.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“I want there to be life on Mars more than anyone else,” he had said, “but it doesn't matter what I want. The evidence isn’t there.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLooking back at how the decades-long research on the Earth’s “missing” fossil record has changed our understanding of life on Earth, Schopf writes, “While this particular paradigm shift pales in comparison with Copernicus’ realization that the Earth flies around the sun, not the other way around, it too is fundamental, the root of two new fields of science, Precambrian paleobiology and astrobiology.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt age 78, he continues to work seven days a week, searching for more answers.\u003c/p\u003e\n","content":"UCLA paleobiologist’s pursuit to uncover Earth’s earliest record of life has spanned 60 years and counting.

They are important for everyone, and quite critical for people with no other access to open space,” said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. “Parks fulfill some basic human needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParks offer places to relax, play and exercise. They help people be healthy. But an examination of parks in Los Angles also raises important questions of fairness, equity and opportunity. Who has access to parks? Do some people have more access than others? Where are parks and why are they where they are? How much park space does Los Angeles have? Should there be more? Where should they be, what should they be like, and what kind of services should they offer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData for Democracy in Los Angeles partnered with the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies in the Luskin School to explore these and other questions about parks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the brief begins, it makes clear the entire region of Los Angeles sits on Indigenous lands. The brief offers access to maps detailing Tongva lands and podcasts acknowledging the Tongva people as the caretakers of Tovaangar, better known today as the Los Angeles basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more than 600 parks in Los Angeles, but about four in 10 people lack access to a park in walking distance from where they live. The brief offers students an interactive map showing where parks are, and importantly, charts and maps detailing what areas have more park space and what neighborhoods have less. For example, one data representation examines \u003ca href=\"https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/data-for-democracy/briefs/data-representations/\"\u003epark access by median income\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parks ought to be accessible to everyone,” said Madeline Brozen, associate director of the Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brief also explores the kinds of services found in parks in Los Angeles, including charts showing the percentages of specific types of facilities and activities such as baseball fields, playgrounds or pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help students better understand parks, the brief also includes an interview with \u003ca href=\"https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/parks-in-la/\"\u003eLewis Center researchers Brozen and Loukaitou-Sideris\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parks are important because they can be a representation of our civic values,” Brozen said. “Historically they have been places for people to come together for civil discourse. When we have places like parks that are civic and for everyone, there’s more potential to see people who are a representation of who lives in a community. I hope this brief will inspire youth to think critically and advocate for public spaces where they feel like they belong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also sample discussion questions to help teachers and students explore the issues, ideas for mathematics study and suggestions for student research projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd educators can sign up for free online Padlet accounts where student can share and discuss their work. Educators can submit videos, text and questions on the site.

The brief includes contact information for local officials with responsibilities for parks, and organizations engaged in park issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can also find articles, maps, photos and other resources for imagining a more just Los Angeles with better access to parks and open space. The materials include a link to an article on Frederick and John Olmsted, who in the 1930s produced a visionary plan for parks, playgrounds and beaches in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew research briefs will be published each month during the school year. Additional briefs will take on questions related to immigration, housing, interactions with police, health, transportation and other issues and how they impact the residents of the Los Angeles region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the school year students and teachers participating in UCLA Data for Democracy in Los Angeles are invited to UCLA to share their research and work with researchers at UCLA research centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are hoping this new project will engage students in evidenced-based discussions in classrooms and encourage a dialogue between students across classrooms and schools,” Rogers said. “We want to create a community through the project that will foster dialogue between Los Angeles students and their elected officials about issues of equality and opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is really exciting,” Franke said. “UCLA Data for Democracy in Los Angeles can lead to more interaction and exchange between young people in Los Angeles and researchers at UCLA.

They are important for everyone, and quite critical for people with no other access to open space,” said Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris, professor of urban planning at the UCLA Luskin School of Public Affairs. “Parks fulfill some basic human needs.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eParks offer places to relax, play and exercise. They help people be healthy. But an examination of parks in Los Angles also raises important questions of fairness, equity and opportunity. Who has access to parks? Do some people have more access than others? Where are parks and why are they where they are? How much park space does Los Angeles have? Should there be more? Where should they be, what should they be like, and what kind of services should they offer?\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eData for Democracy in Los Angeles partnered with the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies in the Luskin School to explore these and other questions about parks.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAs the brief begins, it makes clear the entire region of Los Angeles sits on Indigenous lands. The brief offers access to maps detailing Tongva lands and podcasts acknowledging the Tongva people as the caretakers of Tovaangar, better known today as the Los Angeles basin.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are more than 600 parks in Los Angeles, but about four in 10 people lack access to a park in walking distance from where they live. The brief offers students an interactive map showing where parks are, and importantly, charts and maps detailing what areas have more park space and what neighborhoods have less. For example, one data representation examines \u003ca href=\"https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/data-for-democracy/briefs/data-representations/\"\u003epark access by median income\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parks ought to be accessible to everyone,” said Madeline Brozen, associate director of the Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe brief also explores the kinds of services found in parks in Los Angeles, including charts showing the percentages of specific types of facilities and activities such as baseball fields, playgrounds or pools.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eTo help students better understand parks, the brief also includes an interview with \u003ca href=\"https://centerx.gseis.ucla.edu/parks-in-la/\"\u003eLewis Center researchers Brozen and Loukaitou-Sideris\u003c/a\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“Parks are important because they can be a representation of our civic values,” Brozen said. “Historically they have been places for people to come together for civil discourse. When we have places like parks that are civic and for everyone, there’s more potential to see people who are a representation of who lives in a community. I hope this brief will inspire youth to think critically and advocate for public spaces where they feel like they belong.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also sample discussion questions to help teachers and students explore the issues, ideas for mathematics study and suggestions for student research projects.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAnd educators can sign up for free online Padlet accounts where student can share and discuss their work. Educators can submit videos, text and questions on the site. They can also link up online with other UCLA research centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThere are also resources to help students learn more about parks, and suggestions on how to take action to address park access and other issues related to parks. The brief includes contact information for local officials with responsibilities for parks, and organizations engaged in park issues.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eStudents can also find articles, maps, photos and other resources for imagining a more just Los Angeles with better access to parks and open space. The materials include a link to an article on Frederick and John Olmsted, who in the 1930s produced a visionary plan for parks, playgrounds and beaches in Los Angeles.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNew research briefs will be published each month during the school year. Additional briefs will take on questions related to immigration, housing, interactions with police, health, transportation and other issues and how they impact the residents of the Los Angeles region.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAt the end of the school year students and teachers participating in UCLA Data for Democracy in Los Angeles are invited to UCLA to share their research and work with researchers at UCLA research centers.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“We are hoping this new project will engage students in evidenced-based discussions in classrooms and encourage a dialogue between students across classrooms and schools,” Rogers said. “We want to create a community through the project that will foster dialogue between Los Angeles students and their elected officials about issues of equality and opportunity.”\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e“This is really exciting,” Franke said. “UCLA Data for Democracy in Los Angeles can lead to more interaction and exchange between young people in Los Angeles and researchers at UCLA.
