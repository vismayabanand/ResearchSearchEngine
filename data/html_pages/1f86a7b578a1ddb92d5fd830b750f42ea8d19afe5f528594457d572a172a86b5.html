<b><A HREF="https://machinelearning.apple.com/updates/introducing-apple-scholars-aiml"></b><b>Apple Scholars in AI/ML</a></b><br>
Apple Scholars is a program created to recognize the contributions of emerging leaders in computer science and engineering at the graduate and postgraduate level. In recognition of these outstanding PhD students, each scholar receives support for their research and academic travel for two years, internship opportunities, and a two-year mentorship with an Apple researcher in their field.  Nominated students were selected based on their innovative research, record as thought leaders and collaborators in their fields, and unique commitment to take risks and push the envelope in machine learning and AI.
