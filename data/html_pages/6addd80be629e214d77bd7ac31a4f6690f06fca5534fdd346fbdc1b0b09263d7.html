<p><strong>Current research directions, philosophy, research  activities:</strong><br />
  Prof.  Farrell&rsquo;s research is focused on developing advanced navigation, control, and  planning methods to enable new capabilities for autonomous vehicles. His  preference is for every article and student thesis to contain both rigorous  theoretical analysis and experimental demonstration of performance. He has  research interests in the following directions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Aided  inertial navigation for highway applications - Application include lane-level  positioning to support precision lane mapping, vehicle assist and automation  applications, transit vehicle automation, and highway maintenance vehicle  guidance. Aiding from diverse sources  is of interest: GNSS, vision, LIDAR, RADAR.</li>
  <li>Self-Organizing  Approximation Based Control - Precision tracking control for nonlinear systems  with significant modeling error is a challenging task. Our approach uses  on-line function approximation to decrease the effects of the model error. Due  to the fact that the nonlinearities are unknown, self-organization of the  approximator basis elements has both performance and computational benefits.  Our applications have included land, air, and underwater vehicles as well as  critical care ventilators and robotic systems. </li>
  <li>Online  Planning and System Performance Optimization - Currently, our research in this  area is studying distributed self-configuration of camera networks for security  applications. The objective is for a set  of cameras communicating over a wireless network to configure their camera pan,  tilt, and zoom settings to both track the locations of people and acquire  high-resolution imagery at times of convenience. Our approach currently uses methods from game  theory and consensus. Previous topics  under this line of research include tracing of chemical plumes to their sources  and declaration of the source location.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to  sponsored research in these areas, Prof. Farrell advises various undergraduate  and graduate student projects in related areas.</p>
