<p><strong>Undergraduate Major in HCI</strong></p>
<p>In 2020, Carnegie Mellon University became one of the first universities worldwide to offer a primary major in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). Students within the School of Computer Science (SCS) can now declare HCI as their primary major.</p>
<h2 headerid="0" name="text"><strong>About the B.S. in HCI</strong></h2>
<p>The Bachelor of Science in Human-Computer Interaction will produce HCI specialists who are technically skilled and adept at designing and prototyping interactive solutions with the latest digital technologies. Students graduating from the HCI primary will have a unique perspective on how digital products and services impact humans, and also how they can be designed to have a positive impact.</p>
<p>Students in this major will have a strong Computer Science core of programming, algorithms, systems and mathematical foundations, just like the other undergraduate majors in SCS. They will specialize by making core elements of human-computer interaction the primary focus of their upper-level classes, and can explore a large range of HCI topics in greater depth through their elective choices. In the final capstone project course, they will work as part of an interdisciplinary student team to produce innovative digital solutions for a problem presented by a client.</p>
<p><strong>Responding to the Demand for HCI in Tech</strong></p>
<p>Our corporate partners spoke of the need for competitive entry-level professionals who can enter the workforce with a solid understanding of HCI. This technical program will prepare graduates to understand and create innovative services, systems and applications that serve all people. Students will have the opportunity to design for a range of digital technologies, including web, mobile, IoT, VR, AR, sensors, fabrication, gadgets and more.</p>
<p>There is also a need for HCI practitioners with a &quot;T-shaped person&quot; knowledgebase. That is, professionals who exhibit broad knowledge and diverse technical skills, as well as a valuable focus in a specialization area. HCI majors will build a broad foundational knowledge in computing, mathematics and statistics; development skills for digital and interactive technologies; and experience with methods of rapid prototyping, all of which will help them to collaborate with their peers in related fields.</p>
<p><strong>Opportunities for B.S. in HCI Grads</strong></p>
<p>Graduates with this rigorous background will serve key roles in the tech industry. B.S. in HCI graduates will be poised to take on strategic roles at early stages of their careers, including Front End Engineer, Interaction Designer, Technical Product Manager and UX Engineer positions. HCI students aiming for research careers or graduate school can select a senior thesis option and conduct independent research work under the mentorship of HCI faculty.</p>

<h4>OVERVIEW</h4>
<p>Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a fast growing field devoted to the design, implementation, and evaluation of interactive computer-based technology. Examples of HCI products include intelligent computer tutors, wearable computers, social networking sites, and internet-connected personal digital assistants (PDAs). Constructing an HCI product is a cyclic, iterative process that has at least three stages: Design, Implementation, and Evaluation.</p>
<p>The Design stage involves principles of design and human behavior, the Implementation stage principles of computer science, and the Evaluation stage empirical research methods common to several disciplines. There are thus four topical areas to cover in this major: Human Behavior, Design, Implementation, and Evaluation. In slightly more detail, the major involves the following sorts of knowledge and skill:</p>
<h5>Design</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Eliciting from the client, formulating, and articulating functional specifications</li>
	<li>Knowing how human factors and cognitive models should inform design</li>
	<li>Knowing the principles of, and having experience with, communication design</li>
	<li>Understanding how implementation constraints should inform design</li>
	<li>Incorporating evaluation results into iterated designs</li>
</ul>
<h5>Implementation Programming Skills</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Standard programming languages - e.g., C++, Java</li>
	<li>Rapid prototyping skills</li>
	<li>Computational literacy, i.e., knowledge sufficient for effective communication and decision making about:
	<ul style="margin-left:40px">
		<li>interface construction tools and languages</li>
		<li>multimedia authoring tools</li>
		<li>data structures and algorithms</li>
		<li>operating systems, platforms, etc.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h5>Evaluation</h5>
<ul>
	<li>Experimental design</li>
	<li>Focus groups</li>
	<li>Surveys</li>
	<li>Usability testing (Cognitive walkthroughs, user models, heuristic evaluation, GOMS)</li>
	<li>Statistical analysis</li>
</ul>
<p>There are over 45 courses relevant to these areas that are now offered by eight different departments in four different colleges at Carnegie Mellon (School of Computer Science, Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, College of Fine Arts, and Tepper School of Business).</p>
<h4>ABOUT THE ADDITIONAL MAJOR</h4>
<p>The Additional Major in Interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is available to current undergraduate students from any CMU college. Students maintain their primary major, and by adding an additional major in HCI, can explore multiple areas of study during their time at CMU. Applications to the additional major are processed once a year, in the spring (see below).</p>
<p><strong>CURRICULUM</strong></p>
<p>The following requirements are for students entering Fall 2024. </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-48b475d8-7fff-36d4-295e-d1f3cd41ba8d">The Additional Major in Interdisciplinary Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) consists of 12 prerequisite and required courses.</span></p>

To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions.  This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities   through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations  the skills needed to actually build devices.    About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area.  The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: &quot;HCI gadgets&quot;). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models.    The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student.    There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded). However, you should not take this course if you have no programming background. This course assumes no  background in electronics.<br/>

You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, coordinate activity, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify communication challenges within work groups and organizations and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. The intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly participate in when you move to a work environment, and strategies for improving communication within your groups. Because technology is changing communication patterns and outcomes both in organizations and more broadly in society, the course examines these technological changes. Readings come primarily from the empirical research literature.<br/>

<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br/>&quot;Why are things so hard to use these days? Why doesn't this thing I just bought work? Why is this web site so hard to use? These are frustrations that we have all faced from systems not designed with people in mind. The question this course will focus on is: how can we design human-centered systems that people find useful and usable? This course is a broad introduction to designing, prototyping, and evaluating user interfaces. If you take only one course in Human-Computer Interaction, this is the course for you. We will cover theory as well as practical application of ideas from Human-Computer Interaction. Coursework includes lectures, class discussion, homework, class presentations, and group projects. This class is open to all undergrads and grad students, with either technical or non-technical majors. However, there is a programming prerequisite.  &quot;<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-110" title="15-110" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-110');">15-110</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-122" title="15-122" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-122');">15-122</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-104" title="15-104" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-104');">15-104</a><br/>Course Website: <a href="http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/courses/designing-human-centered-software" target="_blank">http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/courses/designing-human-centered-software</a></dd>

<dt class="keepwithnext">05-395 Applications of Cognitive Science</dt>
<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>This course considers the basic and detailed concepts for building software to implement user interfaces (UIs). It considers factors of input, output, application interface, and related infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them. It considers how these aspects are organized and managed within a well-structured object oriented system. We will cover a variety of &quot;front-end&quot; programming contexts, including conventional graphical user interface (GUI) programming for mobile apps (phones, watches), web apps, and regular desktop applications, across a variety of frameworks. We will also cover programming for data-driven and conversational (AI) user interfaces. We will briefly touch on front-end programming for visualizations, games, 3D, and virtual and artificial reality (VR and AR), along with interactive UI tools such as prototypers and resource editors. The homeworks and project in this course will involve extensive object-oriented programming, likely in both Java and JavaScript, so this course is only appropriate for students with a strong programming background.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design.<br/>

<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Learning in Museums brings together students from across the disciplines to consider the design of mediated learning experiences in a project-based inquiry course. Students will be introduced to a range of design research methods and associated frameworks that explore the cognitive, social and affective dimensions of learning in everyday contexts through readings, invited lectures, in-class activities and assignments. Students will conduct a series of short design research studies to define learning goals and develop supporting design concepts intended to improve learning outcomes for diverse participants in informal learning settings (e.g. museums, after-school programs, maker spaces or online). In concept development, we will look at how to position technology and question its role in the setting to engage and foster positive learning interactions and conversation. This semester we will be working with the Carnegie Museum of Natural History as our primary stakeholder. The course will culminate in a media-rich presentation of design concepts and a fielded prototype to a review panel and include a piloted evaluation plan describing how learning outcomes for the project would be assessed.  In consultation with the instructor, students in the graduate section of the course will be assigned an HCI/learning research literature review and presentation related to their project topic.<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">05-823 E-Learning Design Principles and Methods</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Good design is a continuous improvement process that combines scientific principles and data-driven methods to achieve desired outcomes. E-learning design is no exception. In this course, you will learn how to design innovative e-learning, that is, online interactions and technology that make learning more effective and efficient. You will practice instructional design using learning science theories and principles and learning engineering using data-driven methods to discover insights about how learners think. Instructional designers explain and use principles of learning and instruction such as proven ways to support learning-by-doing, like deliberate practice and self-explanation, and proven ways to support multimedia learning from text, visuals, and audio. They employ &quot;backward design&quot;: designing and aligning learning goals, the assessments that measure them, and the instruction that achieves them. But today's learning engineers do not simply design in sequence  and #8212; goals then assessments then instruction  and #8212; but are agile and iterative. They collect qualitative data, for example, by having an expert &quot;think aloud&quot; while performing one of their assessments and use the results to add or change goals. They collect and use quantitative data, for example, by mining learning data from online course interactions or by comparing alternative designs in an A/B experiment. By using data, learning engineers create innovative and effective designs unlike the results of others who rely on science and intuition alone. You will do so too in an end-to-end e-learning design project, where you develop an e-learning module of your choice, continuously improve it, and test it in an A/B experiment.<br/>
