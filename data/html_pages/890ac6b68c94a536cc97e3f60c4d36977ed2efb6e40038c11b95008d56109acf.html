			This course is for Computer Science students who wish to have an  internship experience as part of their curriculum. Students are required  to write a one-page summary statement prior to registration that  explains how their internship connects with their CS curriculum,  specifically on how it uses material they have learned as well as  prepares them for future courses. Near the end of the internship,  students will be required to submit a reflection paper that describes  the work they did in more detail, including lessons learned about the  work experience and how they utilized their CS education to work  effectively. International students should consult with the Office of  International Education for appropriate paperwork and additional  requirements before registration. Units earned count toward the total  required units necessary for degree completion; students should speak  with an academic advisor for details. This course may be taken at most 3  times for a total of 9 units maximum. Students normally register for  this course for use during the summer semester.

			A course in fundamental computing principles for students with minimal or no  computing background. Programming constructs: sequencing, selection,  iteration, and recursion. Data organization: arrays and lists. Use of  abstraction in computing: data representation, computer organization,  computer networks, functional decomposition, and application programming  interfaces. Use of computational principles in problem-solving: divide and conquer, randomness, and concurrency. Classification of computational problems  based on complexity, non-computable functions, and using heuristics to  find reasonable solutions to complex problems. Social, ethical and legal  issues associated with the development of new computational artifacts will  also be discussed.

			<p>A technical introduction to the fundamentals of programming with an emphasis on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Starting from first principles, we will cover a large subset of the Python programming language, including its standard libraries and programming paradigms. We will also target numerous deployment scenarios, including standalone programs, shell scripts, and web-based applications. This course assumes no prior programming experience. Even so, it is a fast-paced and rigorous preparation for 15-122. Students seeking a more gentle introduction to computer science should consider first taking 15-110. NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer Science course.</p>

			An introduction to programming based on a "functional" model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs---that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.    NOTE: students must achieve a C or better in order to use   this course to satisfy the pre-requisite for any subsequent Computer   Science course.

			Probability theory is indispensable in computer science today. In areas such as artificial intelligence and computer science theory, probabilistic reasoning and randomization are central. Within networks and systems, probability is used to model uncertainty and queuing latency. This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation. The course has 3 parts:  Part I is an introduction to probability, including discrete and continuous random variables, heavy tails, simulation, Laplace transforms, z-transforms, and applications of generating functions. Part II is an in-depth coverage of concentration inequalities, like the Chernoff bound and SLLN bounds, as well as their use in randomized algorithms.  Part III covers Markov chains (both discrete-time and continuous-time) and stochastic processes and their application to queuing systems performance modeling. This is a fast-paced class which will cover more material than the other probability options and will cover it in greater depth.

			This course is about the theory and practice of Artificial Intelligence. We will study modern techniques for computers to represent task-relevant information and make intelligent (i.e. satisficing or optimal) decisions towards the achievement of goals. The search and problem solving methods are applicable throughout a large range of industrial, civil, medical, financial, robotic, and information systems.  We will investigate questions about AI systems such as: how to represent knowledge, how to effectively generate appropriate sequences of actions and how to search among alternatives to find optimal or near-optimal solutions.  We will also explore how to deal with uncertainty in the world, how to learn from experience, and how to learn decision rules from data.  We expect that by the end of the course students will have a thorough understanding of the algorithmic foundations of AI, how probability and AI are closely interrelated, and how automated agents learn.  We also expect students to acquire a strong appreciation of the big-picture aspects of developing fully autonomous intelligent agents.  Other lectures will introduce additional aspects of AI, including natural language processing, web-based search engines, industrial applications, autonomous robotics, and economic/game-theoretic decision making.

Formal approaches to defining the syntax and semantics are used to describe the fundamental concepts underlying programming languages. A variety of programming paradigms are covered such as imperative, functional, logic, and concurrent programming. In addition to the formal studies, experience with programming in the languages is used to illustrate how different design goals can lead to radically different languages and models of computation.

			This course gives students an overview of Cloud Computing, which is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures.  Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the clouds motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models. Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.

			The objective of this course is to study algorithms for general computational problems, with a focus on the principles used to design those algorithms. Efficient data structures will be discussed to support these algorithmic concepts. Topics include: Run time analysis, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, network flow algorithms, linear and integer programming, large-scale search algorithms and heuristics, efficient data storage and query, and NP-completeness. Although this course may have a few programming assignments, it is primarily not a programming course. Instead, it will focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for general classes of problems. This course is not open to CS graduate students who should consider taking 15-651 instead. THIS COURSE IS NOT OPEN TO COMPUTER SCIENCE MAJORS OR MINORS.

			Many problems in science, engineering, and computer graphics cannot be solved exactly. Numerical computing provides methods to approximate these solutions using computational techniques. It combines mathematics and programming to solve real-world problems such as simulations, optimization, and data analysis.

The course begins with a review of key mathematical concepts like vector spaces, matrices, and calculus. We then explore how numbers are represented on computers, the types of errors that can occur, and strategies to handle them. Core topics include solving linear and nonlinear systems, eigenvalue problems, optimization, and techniques such as LU decomposition, QR factorization, and singular value decomposition (SVD). We will also cover iterative methods for large systems, interpolation, numerical differentiation, integration, and both ordinary and partial differential equations.

Students will gain hands-on experience implementing algorithms and learn to balance accuracy, stability, and efficiency in computational solutions.

			In this course, we will first cover the biological and psychological foundational knowledge of biological perceptual systems, and then apply computational thinking to investigate the principles and mechanisms underlying natural perception. The course will focus on vision this year, but will also touch upon other sensory modalities. You will learn how to reason scientifically and computationally about problems and issues in perception, how to extract the essential computational properties of those abstract ideas, and finally how to convert these into explicit mathematical models and computational algorithms. Topics include perceptual representation and inference, perceptual organization, perceptual constancy, object recognition, learning and scene analysis. Prerequisites: First year college calculus, some basic knowledge of linear algebra and probability and some programming experience are desirable.

			Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and "team programming" skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.  Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester begins to discuss your educational goals.

			The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build, install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.  Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a 15-410 student kernel.  In some situations students may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus 12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.  Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities such as: learning a revision control system, writing a short design document, creating and updating a simple project plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing scattered information about hardware and software, classifying and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people over a long period of time, etc.

			<p>Many CS and ECE students will be developing software and hardware that must be ultra reliable at some point in their careers. Logical errors in such designs can be costly, even life threatening. There have already been a number of well publicized errors like the Intel Pentium floating point error and the Arian 5 crash. In this course we will study tools for finding and preventing logical errors. Three types of tools will be studied: automated theorem proving, state exploration techniques like model checking and tools based on static program analysis. Although students will learn the theoretical basis for such tools, the emphasis will be on actually using them on real examples. This course can be used to satisfy the Logic &amp; Languages requirement for the Computer Science major.</p>

			The fundamental principles and engineering tradeoffs involved in designing modern parallel computers, as well as the programming techniques to effectively utilize these machines. Topics include naming shared data, synchronizing threads, and the latency and bandwidth associated with communication. Case studies on shared-memory, message-passing, data-parallel and dataflow machines will be used to illustrate these techniques and tradeoffs. Programming assignments will be performed on one or more commercial multiprocessors, and there will be a significant course project.

			The goals of this course are twofold: First, for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across the network. Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.

			The emphasis in this course will be on the basic performance and engineering trade-offs in the design and implementation of computer networks. To make the issues more concrete, the class includes several multi-week projects requiring significant design and implementation.    The goal is for students to learn not only what computer networks are and how they work today, but also why they are designed the way they are and how they are likely to evolve in the future. We will draw examples primarily from the Internet. Topics to be covered include: network architecture, routing, congestion/flow/error control, naming and addressing,  peer-to-peer and the web, internetworking, and network security.

			<p>Computational photography is the convergence of computer graphics, computer vision and imaging. Its role is to overcome the limitations of the traditional camera, by combining imaging and computation to enable new and enhanced ways of capturing, representing, and interacting with the physical world. This advanced undergraduate course provides a comprehensive overview of the state of the art in computational photography. At the start of the course, we will study modern image processing pipelines, including those encountered on mobile phone and DSLR cameras, and advanced image and video editing algorithms. Then we will proceed to learn about the physical and computational aspects of tasks such as 3D scanning, coded photography, lightfield imaging, time-of-flight imaging, VR/AR displays, and computational light transport. Near the end of the course, we will discuss active research topics, such as creating cameras that capture video at the speed of light, cameras that look around walls, or cameras that can see through tissue. The course has a strong hands-on component, in the form of seven homework assignments and a final project. In the homework assignments, students will have the opportunity to implement many of the techniques covered in the class, by both acquiring their own images of indoor and outdoor scenes and developing the computational tools needed to extract information from them. For their final projects, students will have the choice to use modern sensors provided by the instructors (lightfield cameras, time-of-flight cameras, depth sensors, structured light systems, etc.). This course requires familiarity with linear algebra, calculus, programming, and doing computations with images. The course does not require prior experience with photography or imaging.</p>

			The goal of this course is to acquaint students with the code required to turn ideas into games. This includes both runtime systems -- e.g., AI, sound, physics, rendering, and networking -- and the asset pipelines and creative tools that make it possible to author content that uses these systems. In the first part of the course, students will implement small games that focus on specific runtime systems, along with appropriate asset editors or exporters. In the second part, students will work in groups to build a larger, polished, open-ended game project. Students who have completed the course will have the skills required to extend -- or build from scratch -- a modern computer game.  Students wishing to take this class should be familiar with the C++ language and have a basic understanding of the OpenGL API. If you meet these requirements but have not taken Computer Graphics (the formal prerequisite), please contact the instructor.

			Autonomous agents use perception, cognition, actuation, and learning to reliably achieve desired goals, where the agents can be smart homes, mobile robots, intelligent factories, self-driving cars, etc. The goal of this course is to introduce students to techniques needed for developing complete, integrated AI-based autonomous agents. Topics include architectures for intelligent agents; autonomous behaviors, perception, and execution; reasoning under uncertainty; optimization; execution monitoring; machine learning; scheduling; and explanation. A focus of the course will be on the integration and testing of autonomous systems to achieve reliable and robust behavior in the face of sensor noise and uncertainty.  The course is project-oriented where small teams of students will design, implement, and evaluate agents that can grow plants autonomously, without human intervention.

			Probability theory is indispensable in computer science today. In areas such as artificial intelligence and computer science theory, probabilistic reasoning and randomization are central. Within networks and systems, probability is used to model uncertainty and queuing latency. This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation. The course has 3 parts:  Part I is an introduction to probability, including discrete and continuous random variables, heavy tails, simulation, Laplace transforms, z-transforms, and applications of generating functions. Part II is an in-depth coverage of concentration inequalities, like the Chernoff bound and SLLN bounds, as well as their use in randomized algorithms.  Part III covers Markov chains (both discrete-time and continuous-time) and stochastic processes and their application to queuing systems performance modeling. This is a fast-paced class which will cover more material than the other probability options and will cover it in greater depth.

			Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems.  The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware  simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and "team programming" skills (source control,  modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.    Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at  Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able  to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement  arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The  instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before  the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.    Auditing:  this course is usually full, and we generally receive  many more requests to audit than we can accept.  If you wish to  audit, please have your advisor contact us before the semester  begins to discuss your educational goals.

			The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience  with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the  real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build,  install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system  project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project;  and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding  standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be  submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.    Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the  instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the  context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project  (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or  to extend a 15-410 student kernel.  In some situations students  may work alone.  Group membership and unit count (9 units versus  12) will be decided by the third week of the semester.    Contributing to a real-world project will involve engaging  in some mixture of messy, potentially open-ended activities  such as: learning a revision control system, writing a  short design document, creating and updating a simple project  plan, participating in an informal code review, synthesizing  scattered information about hardware and software, classifying  and/or reading large amounts of code written by various people  over a long period of time, etc.

			<p>Many CS and ECE students will be developing software and hardware that must be ultra reliable at some point in their careers. Logical errors in such designs can be costly, even life threatening. There have already been a number of well publicized errors like the Intel Pentium floating point error and the Ariane 5 crash. In this course we will study tools for finding and preventing logical errors. Three types of tools will be studied: automated theorem proving, state exploration techniques like model checking and tools based on static program analysis. Although students will learn the theoretical basis for such tools, the emphasis will be on actually using them on real examples. &nbsp;This course can be used to satisfy the Logic &amp; Languages requirement for the Computer Science major.</p>

			This course gives students an overview of Cloud Computing, which is the delivery of computing as a service over a network, whereby distributed resources are rented, rather than owned, by an end user as a utility. Students will study its enabling technologies, building blocks, and gain hands-on experience through projects utilizing public cloud infrastructures.  Cloud computing services are widely adopted by many organizations across domains.  The course will introduce the cloud and cover the topics of data centers, software stack, virtualization, software defined networks and storage, cloud storage, and programming models. We will start by discussing the cloud¿s motivating factors, benefits, challenges, service models, SLAs and security. We will describe several concepts behind data center design and management, which enable the economic and technological benefits of the cloud paradigm. Next, we will study how CPU, memory and I/O resources, network (SDN) and storage (SDS) are virtualized, and the key role of virtualization to enable the cloud. Subsequently, students will study cloud storage concepts like data distribution, durability, consistency and redundancy. We will discuss distributed file systems, NoSQL databases and object storage using HDFS, CephFS, HBASE, MongoDB, Cassandra, DynamoDB, S3, and Swift as case studies. Finally, students will study the MapReduce, Spark and GraphLab programming models.  Students will work with Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, to rent and provision compute resources and then program and deploy applications using these resources. Students will develop and evaluate scaling and load balancing solutions, work with cloud storage systems, and develop applications in several programming paradigms. 15619 students must complete an extra team project which entails designing and implementing a cost- and performance-sensitive web-service for querying big data.

			The goals of this course are twofold: First, for students to gain an understanding of the principles and techniques behind the design of distributed systems, such as locking, concurrency, scheduling, and communication across the network. Second, for students to gain practical experience designing, implementing, and debugging real distributed systems.  The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.

			The objective of this course is to study general computational problems, with a focus on the principles used to design those algorithms. Efficient data structures will be discussed to support these algorithmic concepts. Topics include: Run time analysis, divide-and-conquer algorithms, dynamic programming algorithms, network flow algorithms, linear and integer programming, large-scale search algorithms and heuristics, efficient data storage and query, and NP-completeness. Although this course will have several programming assignments, it is primarily not a programming course. Instead, it will focus on the design and analysis of algorithms for general classes of problems. This course is not open to CS graduate students who should consider taking 15-651 instead.

			This course discusses in depth many of the concepts underlying the design, definition, implementation, and use of modern programming languages. Formal approaches to defining the syntax and semantics are used to describe the fundamental concepts underlying programming languages. A variety of programming paradigms are covered such as imperative, functional, logic, and concurrent programming. In addition to the formal studies, experience with programming in the languages is used to illustrate how different design goals can lead to radically different languages and models of computation.
