Our faculty members spend significant amounts of time searching for resources to support their research. With additional financial support from a professorship fund, our faculty can focus their work on creating and sharing new and exciting research. Professorships may be funded in one time gifts, installments, or to the endowment to provide funding in perpetuity.</p></a><a href="https://givenow.cmu.edu/campaigns/42968/donations/new?a=8893516&amp;designation=roboticsprofessorshipfund" target="_top">Choose this Fund</a></div><div class="rsGrid-item rsContent solid invert red " data-keywords="Student Support, Faculty &amp; Student Support, Scholarships"><a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/funds/scott-krulcik-scholarship-fund"><h4>Scott Krulcik Scholarship Fund</h4><p>The Scott Robert Krulcik Scholarship Fund in Computer Science will be used to establish a merit-based scholarship to acknowledge and reward a current undergraduate student (or students) in their junior or senior years who are enrolled in CMU’s School of Computer Science and who have clearly demonstrated the core traits, attitude, and approach that embodied Scott.</p></a><a href="https://givenow.cmu.edu/campaigns/42968/donations/new?a=7672798&amp;designation=scottkrulcikendowedscholarship&amp;" target="_top">Choose this Fund</a></div><div class="rsGrid-item rsContent solid invert darkgrey " data-keywords="SCS Priority Funds, Student Initiatives"><a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/funds/scs-tartanhacks-program"><h4>SCS TartanHacks Program </h4><p>Gifts to SCS TartanHacks support CMU&#39;s annual undergrad-only hackathon, which also attracts students from other colleges and universities.</p></a><a href="https://givenow.cmu.edu/campaigns/42968/donations/new?a=7672798&amp;designation=scstartanhacksprogram&amp;" target="_top">Choose this Fund</a></div><div class="rsGrid-item rsContent solid invert red " data-keywords="SCS Priority Funds, Faculty &amp; Student Support"><a href="https://cs.cmu.edu/funds/scs-yes-fund"><h4>SCS Yes!
