One way that has long been argued to improve such learning is by having students practice new knowledge by spacing questions over time (spaced retrieval practice). However, the evidence for the benefits of spaced retrieval practice in STEM contexts is limited. How can learn by doing be optimized in STEM classes and what computational algorithms best capture this learning?</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement: </strong>Students will be involved in all steps of experimental research, data analytics, and student modeling.</p><p><strong>Skills we are interested in (not all required):</strong></p><ul><li>Quantitative data analyses</li><li>Experience with experimental design and data collection</li><li>Data science/learning analytics/student modeling experience preferred but not required</li></ul><p><br><a class="ck-anchor" id="project2"></a>_____&nbsp;</p><h3>Project 2&nbsp;<br>AI-Assisted Conflict Resolution for Policy Changes</h3><p><strong>Mentor: </strong><a href="/people/tzu-sheng-kuo" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="32969071-01f9-485c-b606-4477bb6d3a77" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Tzu-Sheng Kuo">Tzu-Sheng Kuo</a>, graduate student advised by faculty Haiyi Zhu and Ken Holstein</p><p><strong>Description: </strong>Communities often rely on regulatory policies for governance. For instance, online communities like Reddit have content moderation rules that determine what can be posted in each subreddit. However, community members may interpret these rules differently or hold conflicting views on how they should be enforced, leading to inconsistent decision-making and frustration. In this project, we are developing an AI-assisted, end-to-end system that enables community members to collaboratively identify the root causes of their disagreements and iteratively revise their communal rules to resolve these conflicts. The student will build on our previous work to develop an end-to-end system and conduct user studies within real-world community contexts.</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement: </strong>The student will implement the full-stack system, conduct the user study, and potentially write and submit a paper to top-tier HCI conferences.</p><p><strong>Skills we are interested in (not all required):</strong></p><ul><li>The student should have experience in full-stack web development (e.g., Svelte, Firebase) and a background in NLP (e.g., fine-tuning BERT models).&nbsp;</li><li>Experience with running user studies or crowdsourcing studies (e.g., using Amazon Mechanical Turk) is also a plus.&nbsp;</li></ul><p><br><a class="ck-anchor" id="project3"></a>_____&nbsp;</p><h3>Project 3&nbsp;<br>Auditing AI 3D Object Datasets</h3><p><strong>Mentor: </strong><a href="/people/william-agnew" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d5cd032-19cd-4ac0-90b0-dbe746a629b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="William Agnew">William Agnew</a>, Carnegie Bosch postdoctoral fellow</p><p><strong>Description: </strong>Recently, there has been a surge of interest in AI for generating 3D objects, driven by successes in text-to-image AI. Like image generative AI, 3D object generative AI requires massive datasets of 3D objects. These datasets are likely being scraped from online repositories of 3D models and other sources. In audio, text, and visual domains, dataset practices have caused numerous ethical issues, including intellectual property theft, economic harms, bias, toxicity, CSAM, NCII, and misrepresentation. In this project, we conduct the first audit of 3D AI dataset contents and practices to understand what is in these datasets and how they are being created. This audit will help anticipate and mitigate harm with 3D AI trained on large datasets.</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement: </strong>REU students will conduct a literature review to identify popular 3D object datasets, and conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses in partnership with other collaborators to assess their contents.</p><p><strong>Skills we are interested in (not all required):</strong></p><ul><li>Competency with python</li><li>Experience with lit reviews, audits, and qualitative or quantitative methods a plus</li></ul><p><br><a class="ck-anchor" id="project4"></a>_____&nbsp;</p><h3>Project 4<br>Codesigning AI Dataset Exploration Websites</h3><p><strong>Mentor: </strong><a href="/people/william-agnew" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d5cd032-19cd-4ac0-90b0-dbe746a629b8" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="William Agnew">William Agnew</a>, Carnegie Bosch postdoctoral fellow</p><p><strong>Description: </strong>The contents of datasets used to create AI have emerged as key considerations in ethical, legal, and policy considerations. In audio, text, and image modalities, multiple lawsuits have been filed by people who are in these datasets. These lawsuits and other policy discussions will have major impacts on who profits from AI, and what rights people in AI datasets have. Key to these legal battles have been websites that enable people to easily search through large AI datasets and find if they are in them, or explore other aspects, such as bias and toxicity. However, these websites remain ad-hoc, and little about how they are used is known. In this project, we will conduct user studies and codesign on an existing website for exploring the contents of audio datasets. This study will uncover what questions people have about these datasets, how effective current data exploration websites are at answering them, and develop new features to enable the public to better understand these key components of AI.</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement: </strong>Students will conduct design and update of dataset exploration website features, and conduct and analyze interviews with people using the website.</p><p><strong>Skills we are interested in (not all required):</strong></p><ul><li>HTML, Javascript, Node.js competency are required</li><li>Previous experience with interviews, surveys, or qualitative methods helpful<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a class="ck-anchor" id="project5"></a>_____ &nbsp;</p><h3>Project 5<br>Codespec: A Computer Programming Environment</h3><p><strong>Mentor: </strong><a href="/people/carl-haynes-magyar" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="33ab8bcd-bb90-411c-839a-06e55ad3d652" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Carl Haynes-Magyar">Carl Haynes-Magyar</a>, presidential postdoctoral fellow</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> Despite the potential of Parsons problems, few environments offer a seamless transition between different problem types.

By embedding interfaces directly into users' environments, XR interfaces can both enhance productivity and be less distracting than traditional computing devices such as smartphones. &nbsp;In this research, we aim to design algorithms that create context-aware XR interfaces, i.e., interfaces that automatically adjust when, where, and how to display XR interfaces. These algorithms can be optimization-based or learning-based, and form the backbone of XR systems that continuously adapt to users' needs and requirements when they interact with XR systems in a wide range of applications, from productivity, entertainment, manufacturing, or healthcare.The research involves developing a novel algorithm for adaptive XR, and evaluating the approach in a comparative user study.</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement:</strong> Students will collaborate with other undergraduate and graduate students in creating the concept and planning of the research, and lead the implementation of the algorithm and the creation of the user study platform.</p><p><strong>Skills we are interested in (not all required):</strong></p><ul><li>Strong programming skill (c# or similar)&nbsp;</li><li>Experience with Unity or Unreal</li><li>Interest in XR<br>&nbsp;</li></ul><p><a class="ck-anchor" id="project9"></a>_____&nbsp;</p><h3>Project 9<br>Designing Context-aware AI-driven Assistants to Help Patients</h3><p><strong>Mentor:</strong> <a href="/people/mayank-goel" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7c0ffb3c-68e5-49d2-bfb9-f0c0bec13830" data-entity-substitution="canonical" title="Mayank Goel">Mayank Goel</a>, faculty</p><p><strong>Description:</strong> We aim to guide patients through their recovery process using lightweight sensing and behavior modeling.

We are part of a long term project looking to build a better research infrastructure for using games as research instruments. To support this effort we need to better understand the challenges that have been faced by academic games in the past, with a particular focus on those that have not survived to the present day. This project will involve taking a census of the landscape of educational games from the past 10 years or more, finding how many of them are still discoverable, and reaching out to developers to identify challenges they encountered with long term support and research.</p><p><strong>Nature of Student Involvement: </strong>The overall project will have three phases, which the REU will be involved in based on the pace of the work during the summer.
