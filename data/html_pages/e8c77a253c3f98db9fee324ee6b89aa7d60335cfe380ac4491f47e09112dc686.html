<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>CSD Computer Facilities -- CSD-CF</FONT></B></CENTER>


<P>Welcome to the Computer Science Department at Stanford!&nbsp; The Gates
Building houses the department and around 1000 computers.&nbsp; CSD Computer
Facilities (CSD-CF) administers many of those computers, including the
department's general student computers: Xenon and the Pups.

<P>Here we'll discuss some things that CSD-CF is involved with,
including: Xenon computer accounts, CS email addresses and the
programs pedit and lookup.&nbsp; We'll also talk about reading email
and news, reporting problems and getting more information.

<P><B>Your Xenon computer account</B>

<P>The Computer Science Department provides each CSD student with a Unix
computer account.&nbsp; Most CSD students will have an account on a
computer called <B>Xenon</B>, which is a Sun Enterprise 3000 running Solaris
2.6.&nbsp; This same account allows you to log in to the <B>Pup</B> cluster
machines (pup1, pup2, etc.) in the Gates basement (Gates B21) -- these are
Intel PCs, some running Solaris 2.5.1 and some runnings Windows NT.

<P>To obtain a Xenon account, fill out a Computer Account Request
Form.&nbsp; You should have received one in the mail, but there should be
another in this packet or you can get one from Gates 185 from a mailbox in
the back part of the room on the right.&nbsp; Return the completed form to
the slot in the file cabinet outside Gates 185.&nbsp; The account will be
opened in a day or two.

<P>The first thing you should do when you initially log into your Xenon
account is change your password with the <B>passwd</B> command.&nbsp; Your
password should not include any part of your name or user ID or address,
etc., and it should not contain any words from any languages, spelled
correctly or not.&nbsp; It is a good idea to include both upper and lower
case characters as well as digits and punctuation in your password.
Remember that the security of our systems starts with your having a good
password -- one that can't be cracked.

<P>If you are unable to log in to your Xenon account, come to CSD-CF in
Gates offices 161 to 170 during business hours and someone will help you.

<P>Note: Do not run compute-intensive jobs on Xenon or the Pups.&nbsp; Also
none of these student machines is to be used for sponsored research -- the
research groups provide their own computers for that.  <BR>&nbsp;

<BR><B>CS email addresses</B>

<P>Everyone in the CS Department, and in fact everyone in the Gates
Building (which includes folks from CS and from EE), has or can have a
permanent CS email address, which can forward wherever desired.&nbsp; Your
Xenon user ID is also your CS user name for electronic mail.&nbsp; Instead
of having people send mail to you at Xenon.Stanford.EDU, you should have
them send mail to you at CS.Stanford.EDU.&nbsp; (You cannot actually log in
to the computer named CS -- CS is for email only.).  Mail sent to you at CS
is initially set up to be forwarded to your Xenon account (you can then
read it on Xenon or the Pups).&nbsp; Mail you send from Xenon will have CS
(not Xenon) in your return address.

<P>You can change your CS mail forwarding by running the <B>pedit</B>
program on Xenon and selecting <B>email information</B>.&nbsp; Note that
forwarding changes made with pedit take up to an hour to become effective.
Also your CS forwarding address takes precedence over any <TT>.forward</TT>
file you may have on Xenon.&nbsp; For more on mail forwarding, including
the interaction between your CS forwarding address and your
<TT>.forward</TT> file, give the command
<B>/usr/local/bin/help&nbsp;forward</B> on Xenon.

<P><B>pedit/lookup</B>

<P>Please use the <B>lookup</B> command to check your information in the
CSD database.&nbsp; Or use it to look up anyone else in our database.&nbsp;
Specify a CS address (lookup smith@cs) or a last name (lookup smith) or
first and last name (lookup john smith) in order to specify whose data you
wish to see.

<P>To make changes to your information in the database, run the <B>pedit</B>
program (with no arguments).&nbsp; Keeping your database entry up-to-date
is your responsibility and is very important (for example, the email address
is used to generate department-wide mailing lists).&nbsp; You can run lookup
and pedit from many of the UNIX hosts in the department.

<P>Please be responsible when making changes to your PEDIT entry.&nbsp;
The department does not look favorably upon obscene names, titles, or addresses.&nbsp;
Also, please keep your entry meaningful and accurate.&nbsp; People use
this database to locate you, so an erroneous entry could lead them astray.

<P>The lookup and pedit programs access the CSD (PEDIT) database.&nbsp;
To access the campus-wide database, use the <B>whois</B> program.&nbsp;
Unfortunately, these two databases are not currently connected.&nbsp; (With
whois, you may have to specify "whois.stanford.edu" -- or just "whois"
-- as the whois host.)

<P><B>Communication via email and csd.bboard</B>

<P>There are many programs that you can use to read and send electronic
mail. These include eudora, zmail, elm, pine, mh, xmh, exmh, emacs/rmail,
emacs/vm, mail, etc.&nbsp; See the man pages for more information about
these alternatives or ask the folks you work with.

<P>The most commonly used programs for reading newsgroups are <B>trn</B> and
<B>netscape</B>.  Other newsreaders exist, and you may choose a different
one after talking to people about the alternatives.&nbsp; You should read
the newsgroup <B>csd.bboard</B> to keep up with what is happening in
CSD.&nbsp; See <B>csd.colloq</B> for information about seminars, phd orals,
etc., and <B>csd.jobs</B> for job offers and information.&nbsp; Also, read
at least one of <B>csd.phdcs</B>, <B>csd.mscs</B>, <B>csd.bscs</B>,
<B>csd.phdsccm</B> and <B>csd.mssccm</B>.&nbsp; You can send messages to
csd.bboard by sending email to csd.bboard@cs.&nbsp; Note: job announcements
should go to jobs@cs, NOT to csd.bboard.&nbsp; You can subscribe to job
announcements with pedit (select relations).

<P><B>Reporting CSD computer problems</B> <BR>&nbsp; <BR>

If you notice a computer, printer or network down, or if you need a file
restored or an IP address, point your web browser at 

<A href="http://csdcf.stanford.edu">http://csdcf.stanford.edu</A>

and click on <A href="http://csdcf.stanford.edu/support/support.html"> Get
Help</A>.  Fill in the appropriate form and submit it to let us know the
problem.  If for some reason you can't access the web, send a message to
action at the appropriate computer, e.g., <B>action@xenon</B>.&nbsp; If the
particular machine is down or mail isn't working there, send your message
to <B>action@cs</B>.&nbsp; Before sending a message, you might want to see
if we already know about the problem by using the <B>finger@cs</B> command,
which shows information on expected downtimes.&nbsp; If you are unable even
to send email, you can call CSD-CF at 650-725-1451 or drop by Gates offices
161 to 170.
