<p>Carnegie Mellon founded one of the first Computer Science departments in the world in 1965. As research and teaching in computing grew at a tremendous pace at Carnegie Mellon, the university formed the School of Computer Science (SCS) at the end of 1988. Carnegie Mellon was one of the first universities to elevate Computer Science into its own academic college at the same level as the Mellon College of Science and the College of Engineering. Today, SCS consists of seven departments and institutes, including the Computer Science Department that started it all, along with the Ray and Stephanie Lane Computational Biology Department, the Human-Computer Interaction Institute, the Language Technologies Institute, the Machine Learning Department, the Robotics Institute and the Software and Societal Systems Department (formerly the Institute for Software Research). Together, these units make SCS a world leader in research and education. Over the last seven years, SCS has launched four new primary undergraduate majors in Computational Biology, Artificial Intelligence (the first of its kind in the United States), Human-Computer Interaction, and Robotics. These new majors, along with the highly-ranked Computer Science major, give students in SCS distinct paths in the field of computing with ample opportunities in industry and advanced research. </p>
<p>The School of Computer Science offers the following majors and minors:</p>
<ul>
	<li>B.S. in Artificial Intelligence</li>
	<li>B.S. in Computational Biology</li>
	<li>B.S. in Computer Science</li>
	<li>B.S. in Human-Computer Interaction</li>
	<li>B.S. in Robotics</li>
	<li>Bachelor's in Computer Science and Art (joint with the College of Fine Arts)</li>
	<li>Additional major in Artificial Intelligence</li>
	<li>Additional major in Computational Biology</li>
	<li>Additional major in Computer Science</li>

</ul>
<p>Students who apply to, and are directly admitted into, the School of Computer Science can choose between five primary majors: Artificial Intelligence, Computational Biology, Computer Science, Human-Computer Interaction and Robotics. Students with artistic and computing interests may be given the option to pursue a major in Computer Science and Art. Suitably prepared students from other Carnegie Mellon colleges are eligible to apply for internal transfer to the School of Computer Science and will be considered for transfer if grades in specific requirements are sufficiently high and space is available. Consult the program websites for specific requirements for transfer requests. Computation-oriented programs are also available within the Mellon College of Science, the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, the College of Engineering and the College of Fine Arts. </p>

<h3 headerid="1" name="policiestext">Academic Standards and Actions</h3>
<h5>Grading Practices</h5>
<p>Grades given to record academic performance in SCS are detailed under Grading Practices at <a href="/aboutcmu/undergraduateacademicregulations/">Undergraduate Academic Regulations</a>.</p>
<h5>Dean's List WITH HIGH HONORS</h5>
<p>SCS recognizes each semester those undergraduates who have earned outstanding academic records by naming them to the Dean's List with High Honors. The criterion for such recognition is a semester quality point average of at least 3.75 while completing a minimum of 36 factorable units and earning no incomplete grades.</p>
<h5>Academic Actions</h5>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">To maintain good academic standing, students from SCS must attain a quality point average (QPA) of at least 2.0 for each semester and a cumulative QPA of 2.0 and maintain adequate progress toward completing their degree requirements. For students with incomplete grade(s), default grade(s) will be used in the QPA calculation. For SCS, adequate progress toward completing degree requirements includes passing foundational courses of 15-112, 15-122, 15-151 (or 21-127 if applicable), with grades of C or higher, 21-120 and 21-122 with grades of D or higher by the end of the sophomore year. [updated: 22 Nov 24]. </span>A review of a student’s academic record is completed after each Fall and Spring semester. </p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">A student will no longer be in good standing if they meet any of the following criteria:</span></p>
<ul>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Their semester QPA is below 2.00.</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Their cumulative QPA is below 2.00.</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">They fail to complete a required foundational CS or math course after two or more attempts with a C or higher. These courses include: 15-112, 15-122, 15-151 (or 21-127), 21-120, 21-122.</span></li>
	<li><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">They do not complete their required foundational CS and math requirements by the end of the sophomore year.</span></li>
</ul>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Students who are not in good standing are first put on Academic Warning for the following semester. After that following semester, if the student is still not in good standing, the student will be put on Academic Suspension. However, a student on Academic Warning who is meeting the semester QPA requirement but is not yet meeting other requirements may be continued on Academic Warning. If the QPA is impacted by an incomplete grade, the action will be reviewed once the final grade is posted, and the action will be rescinded if appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">A student is removed from Academic Warning and returned to good academic standing when both the semester and cumulative quality point averages are at least 2.0, and if adequate progress toward completing degree requirements is being made (i.e. completing foundational courses).  </span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">The minimum period of Academic Suspension is one academic year (two non-summer semesters). Academic suspension is meant to allow a student to take a pause from their academic studies to address the issues that are causing poor academic performance. At the end of that period a student may return to campus (on Final Academic Warning) by:</span></p>

</ol>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Upon review by the student's academic advisor and the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs, in consultation with the Office of Student Affairs and the Office of International Education as appropriate, the student may be approved to continue their studies.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">SCS students who return from Academic Suspension will be placed on Final Academic Warning for up to 2 semesters to allow them to return to good academic standing or transfer to another major that is more suitable to their interests and abilities. Students who return to good standing after a return from suspension will be removed from Final Academic Warning. Students who return to good standing after suspension but then do not meet one or more conditions as outlined above will return to Final Academic Warning.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Students who fail to return to good academic standing after two semesters on Final Academic Warning will be dropped from the School of Computer Science. Students who have been dropped and are not admitted to another program at the university are required to absent themselves from the campus (including residence halls and Greek houses) within a maximum of two days after the action.</span></p>
<p><span id="docs-internal-guid-621d2885-7fff-6a9c-10e6-82e7da96258e">Students may appeal an academic warning, suspension or drop decision in writing within 10 business days of notification. Students should consult with their academic advisor before appealing, and should typically only appeal if they believe that an academic action was not correctly determined by the above criteria or if they have substantial additional information which was not available when the academic action was decided and which indicates a timely return to good academic standing. Instructions on the appeal process are given in the warning, suspension or drop letter that is sent to the student.</span></p>
<hr/>
<h3 headerid="2" name="policiestext">Leave of Absence and Return from Leave of Absence</h3>
<p>SCS undergraduate students may elect to take a leave of absence for a variety of reasons, after consultation with their academic advisor. Students who wish to take a leave of absence must do so by the last day of classes before final exams begin and before final grades are posted (in case this is earlier). Students requesting a leave of absence must complete a form from the HUB and have this signed by their academic advisor and SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Students who take a leave of absence up to the last day to drop classes will have all of their classes dropped. Students who take a leave of absence after the last day to drop classes will be assigned a grade of W (withdrawal) for all of their classes. </p>
<p>Students returning from a leave of absence are required to submit a Return from Leave of Absence form to their academic advisor for approval by the student's academic advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. In addition, for students taking a leave for academic performance reasons, the student must also supply a letter that explains the reason for the leave, the actions that were performed during the leave to prepare the student for a successful return, and a description of the on-campus resources, if required, that would be used by the student in order to increase the likelihood of success. Students returning from a leave are also encouraged to provide up to two letters of support from people close to the student (e.g. family, friends, clergy, teachers, coaches, others as appropriate). Requests to return are reviewed by the student's academic advisor, the Associate Dean and the Student Affairs liaison to determine eligibility and any resources that need to be put into place to assist the student upon return. Contact the SCS Undergraduate Office (GHC 4115) for more information.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 headerid="3" name="policiestext">Internal Transfer within SCS</h3>
<p>First year students admitted to SCS are considered undeclared during their first year. These students declare their SCS major in the middle of the second semester of their first year of study. SCS students who wish to transfer from one SCS major to another SCS major may do so by applying for transfer by mid-semester break during the semester the transfer is desired (or the end of the summer session for summer transfers). These students should consult with their academic advisor and the program director of the intended major for more information about specific course requirements and academic plans. Internal SCS transfers do not have any grade requirements. Transfers are approved based on demonstrated interest, ability, and available space in the intended major. Consult the website for the individual SCS major for more information about expected courses to take to demonstrate interest and ability. The transfer request form is available on the SCS website.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 headerid="4" name="policiestext">Transfer into SCS / Dual-Degree</h3>
<p>Undergraduate students admitted to colleges at CMU other than SCS and wishing to transfer to SCS or pursue a dual degree in SCS should consult with the Director or Program Coordinator of the desired SCS major during their first year. See the individual program pages for the names of the current directors and program coordinators, along with their contact information.</p>

<p>Students may apply for transfer by the start of the mid-semester break in the semester when the final course(s) of the six required courses will be completed (or the end of the summer session for summer transfer requests). In the case of course(s) in progress, the mid-semester grades will be used in the QPA calculation. <span id="OLK_SRC_BODY_SECTION">The decision to allow transfer or dual degree will be made by committee based on the student's academic performance (in the specified courses and in their courses overall if necessary), additional involvement in SCS and other computing-related activities, and availability of space in the student's class level.</span> Students should consult the SCS Undergraduate Office for complete information concerning minimum requirements, instructions and deadlines.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 headerid="5" name="policiestext">External Transfer</h3>
<p>A student currently enrolled at another university or college who wishes to transfer to SCS should first apply through the Office of Admission. If the Office of Admission believes the applicant meets admission guidelines, the student's record is sent to SCS for evaluation. Admission is based on seat availability, overall academic performance and course rigor from the student's current institution, ability to complete the rigorous SCS program on time, and the application material including recommendations and reflection essay(s). It is important to note that extremely few external transfers are admitted to the SCS program at Carnegie Mellon University due to space limitations.</p>
<hr/>
<h3 headerid="6" name="policiestext">Graduation Requirements</h3>
<ol>
	<li>A requirement for graduation is the completion of the program specified for a degree with a cumulative quality point average of 2.00 or higher for all courses taken at CMU. </li>
	<li>Students must be recommended for a degree by the faculty of SCS.</li>
	<li>A candidate for the bachelor's degree must complete at the University a minimum of four semesters of full-time study, or the equivalent of part-time study, comprising at least 180 units of course work.</li>
	<li>Students will be required to have met all financial obligations to the university before being awarded a degree.</li>

				<a name="genedtext"></a><h2 headerid="7" name="genedtext">General Education Requirements</h2>
<p>All undergraduate degrees in the School of Computer Science include depth in their particular field of study but also breadth through the general education requirements. General education requirements are part of SCS degrees to give students an opportunity to learn more about the world from scientific and humanistic points of view. These additional skills are useful for graduates since computing is often embedded in domains that are not entirely within the bounds of computing. SCS students will need to use their computing skills to solve problems alongside scientists and engineers, artists, social and cognitive scientists, historians, linguists, economists and business experts, and SCS students will need to communicate effectively and understand the ethical implications of their work. The general education requirements help SCS students gain this broad perspective so they can work well in a wide variety of domains.</p>
<h3 headerid="8" name="genedtext">Science and Engineering</h3>
<p>All candidates for a B.S. degree in the School of Computer Science must complete a minimum of 36 units offered by the Mellon College of Science and/or the College of Engineering (CIT). This includes at least four courses in science and engineering, 9 units or more for each course, where at least one course must have a laboratory component and at least two courses must be from the same department. Consult with your SCS undergraduate advisor for possible use of any mini course for this requirement which needs to be reviewed by your advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs.</p>
<p>For Computational Biology majors, consult the <a href="/schools-colleges/schoolofcomputerscience/undergraduatecomputatonalbiology/">Computational Biology</a> program page for specific science and engineering requirements. The required science and engineering courses for the Computational Biology major also satisfy the General Education requirement for SCS by default. For other SCS majors, consult the lists given below for approved courses.</p>
<p><span>Non-lab courses that satisfy this requirement are given in the list below. (Consult your academic advisor for additional choices available each semester.)</span></p>

<p><strong>C. Humanities and Arts Electives (minimum 27 units)</strong><br/>
Complete 3 non-technical courses of at least 9 units each from any of the departments in the Dietrich College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences or the College of Fine Arts. Some of the courses taught in these units are considered technical courses and may not be used to satisfy this requirement (see Deletions below). Additionally, a select set of courses from Business Administration and from Environmental and Public Policy can also count for this requirement (see Additions below). Students may combine humanities/arts courses with lower units together to form a single course of 9 units or more with advisor approval in consultation with the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Students are encouraged, but not required, to take courses from different departments to gain additional breadth and to create new opportunities for engagement with the university community. </p>

<p>Students considering going on to graduate school in Computer Science or related disciplines should take a wide variety of Computer Science and Mathematics courses, as well as consider getting involved in independent research as early as possible. This would be no later than the junior year and can begin even earlier.  Students interested in graduate school in computer science or its related areas are strongly encouraged to participate in the SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis program. Additionally, graduate CS courses can be taken with permission of the instructor and in consultation with an academic advisor.</p>
<p>The goal of the SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis Program is to introduce students to the breadth of tasks involved in independent research, including library work, problem formulation, experimentation, analysis, technical writing and public speaking. In particular, students write a short paper summarizing prior results and current progress in their desired area of research, present a public poster session in December of their senior year describing their current progress, present their final results with a poster and an oral presentation in the year-end university-wide Undergraduate Research Symposium (Meeting of the Minds) and submit a written thesis at the end of their senior year. Students work closely with faculty research advisors to plan and carry out their research. The <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=07-599" title="07-599" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-599');">07-599</a> SCS Honors Undergraduate Research Thesis</span> typically starts in the fall semester of the senior year, and spans the entire senior year. Students receive a total of 36 units of academic credit for the thesis work, 18 units per semester. Students should prepare their research prospectus (i.e. proposal of work) during the spring semester of their junior year, and students in this program are advised to plan their schedules carefully to ensure there is ample time to perform the required research for the thesis during the senior year.</p>

<p>Students interested in research are urged to consult with their undergraduate advisor and the SCS Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs no later than the end of their sophomore year in order to plan their workload effectively. Although there is no specific QPA requirement to participate, students are expected to have at least a 3.5 QPA in the core SCS topics relevant to their proposed research to be successful in their work. For those students with no background in research, they may consider using <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=07-300" title="07-300" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-300');">07-300</a> Research and Innovation in Computer Science (9 units)</span> as an introduction to the research process in their junior year since this course will introduce students to various research projects going on in the School of Computer Science and important skills that are needed to be an effective researcher. This course leads to a subsequent research practicum, <span class="sc_courseinline"><a href="/search/?P=07-400" title="07-400" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '07-400');">07-400</a> Research Practicum in Computer Science (12 units)</span>, that allows students to complete a small-scale research study or experiment and present a research poster. Students who use this practicum to start their senior thesis can use the 12 units toward the required 36 units. Students should consult with their academic advisor concerning how the units earned toward the senior thesis can be used toward elective requirements for their major. </p>

<p>Interested juniors should submit a project prospectus of 3-4 pages by the end of their junior year, although submissions over the summer prior to the senior year will also be considered for review. A prospectus must include:</p>
<div class="l-page " id="page" style="margin-left:auto">
<div class="l-main-inner">
<div class="l-main-content">
<div class="field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden">
<ul>
	<li>The name of the research advisor (an SCS faculty member)</li>
	<li>A short abstract (two paragraphs, max)</li>
	<li>A description of the problem to be worked on and its significance</li>
	<li>A tactical description of the proposed research plan, including:
	<ul>
		<li>a description of the background reading to be carried out,</li>
		<li>a description of the research contribution,</li>
		<li>a description of the expected results of the research, and</li>
		<li>a reasonably detailed timeline for the thesis work</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>A bibliography of related work (all references belong here)</li>
	<li>The signature of the research advisor, signifying endorsement of the project and willingness to supervise and evaluate it (or an email confirmation from the research advisor)</li>
</ul>
<p>Students who need help finding potential advisors should get in touch with their academic advisor or the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Programs. Applications to the program are due by the start of the senior year, although submission of applications in the junior year is encouraged.</p>
<p>Students completing an outstanding senior thesis based on the judgement of the SCS Undergraduate Review Committee will earn SCS College Honors and can compete for various SCS research awards given out during commencement.</p>

<dt class="keepwithnext">02-223 Personalized Medicine: Understanding Your Own Genome</dt>
<dd>Fall: 9 units<br/>Do you want to know how to discover the tendencies hidden in your genome? Since the first draft of a human genome sequence became available at the start of this century, the cost of genome sequencing has decreased dramatically. Personal genome sequencing will likely become a routine part of medical exams for patients for prognostic and diagnostic purposes. Personal genome information will also play an increasing role in lifestyle choices, as people take into account their own genetic tendencies. Commercial services such as 23andMe have already taken first steps in this direction. Computational methods for mining large-scale genome data are being developed to unravel the genetic basis of diseases and assist doctors in clinics. This course introduces students to biological, computational, and ethical issues concerning use of personal genome information in health maintenance, medical practice, biomedical research, and policymaking. We focus on practical issues, using individual genome sequences (such as that of Nobel prize winner James Watson) and other population-level genome data. Without requiring any background in biology or CS, we begin with an overview of topics from genetics, molecular biology, stats, and machine learning relevant to the modern personal genome era. We then cover scientific issues such as how to discover your genetic ancestry and how to learn from genomes about migration and evolution of human populations. We discuss medical aspects such as how to predict whether you will develop diseases such as diabetes based on your own genome, how to discover disease-causing genetic mutations, and how genetic information can be used to recommend clinical treatments.<br/>

There are many similarities in the goals and strategies of biological and computational systems which suggest that each can learn from the other. These include the distributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central control), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and the ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple applications and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. In this course we will start by discussing classic biologically motivated algorithms including neural networks (inspired by the brain), genetic algorithms (sequence evolution), non-negative matrix factorization (signal processing in the brain), and search optimization (ant colony formation). We will then continue to discuss more recent bi-directional studies that have relied on biological processes to solve routing and synchronization problems, discover Maximal Independent Sets (MIS), and design robust and fault tolerant networks.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Some of the most serious public health problems we face today, from drug-resistant bacteria, to cancer, all arise from a fundamental property of living systems  and #8212; their ability to evolve. Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a> and <a href="/search/?P=21-241" title="21-241" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-241');">21-241</a> and (<a href="/search/?P=15-259" title="15-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-259');">15-259</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-218" title="36-218" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-218');">36-218</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-325" title="21-325" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-325');">21-325</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-225" title="36-225" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-225');">36-225</a>)<br/>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>Automated scientific instruments are used widely in research and engineering. Robots dramatically increase the reproducibility of scientific experiments, and are often cheaper and faster than humans, but are most often used to execute brute-force sweeps over experimental conditions. The result is that many experiments are &quot;wasted&quot; on conditions where the effect could have been predicted. Thus, there is a need for computational techniques capable of selecting the most informative experiments.  This course will introduce students to techniques from Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning for automatically selecting experiments to accelerate the pace of discovery and to reduce the overall cost of research. Real-world applications from Biology, Bioengineering, and Medicine will be studied. Grading will be based on homeworks and two exams.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Computer systems and biological processes often rely on networks of interacting entities to reach joint decisions, coordinate and respond to inputs. There are many similarities in the goals and strategies of biological and computational systems which suggest that each can learn from the other. These include the distributed nature of the networks (in biology molecules, cells, or organisms often operate without central control), the ability to successfully handle failures and attacks on a subset of the nodes, modularity and the ability to reuse certain components or sub-networks in multiple applications and the use of stochasticity in biology and randomized algorithms in computer science. In this course we will start by discussing classic biologically motivated algorithms including neural networks (inspired by the brain), genetic algorithms (sequence evolution), non-negative matrix factorization (signal processing in the brain), and search optimization (ant colony formation). We will then continue to discuss more recent bi-directional studies that have relied on biological processes to solve routing and synchronization problems, discover Maximal Independent Sets (MIS), and design robust and fault tolerant networks.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Some of the most serious public health problems we face today, from drug-resistant bacteria, to cancer, all arise from a fundamental property of living systems  and #8212; their ability to evolve. Since Darwin's theory of natural selection was first proposed, we have begun to understand how heritable differences in reproductive success drive the adaptation of living systems. This makes it intuitive and tempting to view evolution from an optimization perspective. However, genetic drift, phenotypic trade-offs, constraints, and changing environments, are among the many factors that may limit the optimizing force of natural selection. This tug-of-war between selection and drift, between the forces that produce variation in a population, and the forces suppressing this variation, make evolutionary processes much more complex to model and understand than previously thought. The aim of this class is to provide an introduction into the theoretical formalism necessary to understand how biological systems are shaped by the forces and constraints driving evolutionary dynamics.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-112" title="15-112" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-112');">15-112</a> and <a href="/search/?P=21-241" title="21-241" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-241');">21-241</a> and (<a href="/search/?P=36-225" title="36-225" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-225');">36-225</a> or <a href="/search/?P=15-259" title="15-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-259');">15-259</a> or <a href="/search/?P=36-218" title="36-218" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-218');">36-218</a> or <a href="/search/?P=21-325" title="21-325" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-325');">21-325</a>)<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-150 Principles of Functional Programming</dt>
<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br/>An introduction to programming based on a &quot;functional&quot; model of computation.  The functional model is a natural generalization of algebra in which programs are formulas that describe the output of a computation in terms of its inputs and #8212;-that is, as a function.  But instead of being confined to real- or complex-valued functions, the functional model extends the algebraic view to a very rich class of data types, including not only aggregates built up from other types, but also functions themselves as values.  This course is an introduction to programming that is focused on the central concepts of function and type.  One major theme is the interplay between inductive types, which are built up incrementally; recursive functions, which compute over inductive types by decomposition; and proof by structural induction, which is used to prove the correctness and time complexity of a recursive function.  Another major theme is the role of types in structuring large programs into separate modules, and the integration of imperative programming through the introduction of data types whose values may be altered during computation.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Probability theory is indispensable in computer science today. In areas such as artificial intelligence and computer science theory, probabilistic reasoning and randomization are central. Within networks and systems, probability is used to model uncertainty and queuing latency. This course gives an introduction to probability as it is used in computer science theory and practice, drawing on applications and current research developments as motivation. The course has 3 parts:  Part I is an introduction to probability, including discrete and continuous random variables, heavy tails, simulation, Laplace transforms, z-transforms, and applications of generating functions. Part II is an in-depth coverage of concentration inequalities, like the Chernoff bound and SLLN bounds, as well as their use in randomized algorithms.  Part III covers Markov chains (both discrete-time and continuous-time) and stochastic processes and their application to queuing systems performance modeling. This is a fast-paced class which will cover more material than the other probability options and will cover it in greater depth.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-251" title="15-251" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-251');">15-251</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-228" title="21-228" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-228');">21-228</a> Min. grade C<br/>

<dd>Fall and Spring: 15 units<br/>Operating System Design and Implementation is a rigorous hands-on introduction to the principles and practice of operating systems. The core experience is writing a small Unix-inspired OS kernel, in C with some x86 assembly language, which runs on a PC hardware simulator (and on actual PC hardware if you wish).  Work is done in two-person teams, and &quot;team programming&quot; skills (source control, modularity, documentation) are emphasized.  The size and scope of the programming assignments typically result in students significantly developing their design, implementation, and debugging abilities. Core concepts include the process model, virtual memory, threads, synchronization, and deadlock; the course also surveys higher-level OS topics including file systems, interprocess communication, networking, and security.  Students, especially graduate students, who have not satisfied the prerequisite at Carnegie Mellon are strongly cautioned - to enter the class you must be able to write a storage allocator in C, use a debugger, understand 2's-complement arithmetic, and translate between C and x86 assembly language.  The instructor may require you to complete a skills assessment exercise before the first week of the semester in order to remain registered in the class.

<dd>Fall<br/>The goal of this class is for students to acquire hands-on experience with operating-system code as it is developed and deployed in the real world.  Groups of two to four students will select, build, install, and become familiar with an open-source operating system project; propose a significant extension or upgrade to that project; and develop a production-quality implementation meeting the coding standards of that project.  Unless infeasible, the results will be submitted to the project for inclusion in the code base.  Variations on this theme are possible at the discretion of the instructor.  For example, it may be possible to work within the context of a non-operating-system software infrastructure project (window system, web server, or embedded network device kernel) or to extend a <a href="/search/?P=15-410" title="15-410" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-410');">15-410</a> student kernel.

Individual grades will be influenced by peer reviews, individual reflection documents, mentor impressions, and presentation performance. Students will leave the course with a firsthand understanding of the software engineering realities that drive SE practices, will have concrete experience with these practices, and will have engaged in active reflection on this experience. They will have teamwork, process, and product skills to support immediate competency in a software engineering organization, along with a deeper understanding that prepares them to evaluate the new processes and techniques they will encounter in the workplace.<br/>

The major themes this course will teach include scarcity, scheduling, concurrency and concurrent programming, naming, abstraction and modularity, imperfect communication and other types of failure, protection from accidental and malicious harm, optimism, and the use of instrumentation and monitoring and debugging tools in problem solving. As the creation and management of software systems is a fundamental goal of any undergraduate systems course, students will design, implement, and debug large programming projects.   As a consequence, competency in both the C and Java programming languages is required.<br/>Prerequisite: <a href="/search/?P=15-213" title="15-213" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-213');">15-213</a> Min. grade C<br/>

This dual perspective enriches understanding on both sides, and leads to the development of practical algorithms for working with real-world geometric data. Along the way we will revisit important ideas from calculus and linear algebra, putting a strong emphasis on intuitive, visual understanding that complements the more traditional formal, algebraic treatment. The course provides essential mathematical background as well as a large array of real-world examples and applications.

<dt class="keepwithnext">15-749 Post-von Neumann Computer Architecture</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br/>Computing has been dominated by von Neumann CPU architectures for seventy years. The von Neumann architecture is familiar and flexible, but it is also extremely inefficient, wasting upwards of 99% of energy. As computing is now energy-limited across all scales, from IoT to data center, von Neumann's inefficiency can no longer be tolerated. Recently, industry has adopted heterogeneous &quot;accelerator&quot; hardware to boost performance and efficiency. However, accelerators have limited programmability, sacrificing the main benefit of CPU architectures and putting future innovation at risk. This class will survey non-von Neumann general-purpose architectures, recent work on specialized hardware accelerators, and cutting-edge research on &quot;programmable accelerators&quot;.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course will take a random walk through various mathematical topics that come in handy for theoretical computer science. It is intended mainly for students earlier in their graduate studies (or very strong undergraduates) who want to do theory research. The idea for the course comes from other courses by Arora (2002, 2007), Håstad (2004/05), Kelner (2007, 2009), and Tulsiani (2013). Students should have a solid undergraduate background in math (e.g., elementary combinatorics, graph theory, discrete probability, basic algebra/calculus) and theoretical computer science (running time analysis, big-O/Omega/Theta, P and NP, basic fundamental algorithms).<br/>

<dd>Intermittent: 9 units<br/>Should autonomous robots make life and death decisions on their own? Should we allow them to select a target and launch weapons? To diagnose injuries and perform surgery when human doctors are not around? Who should be permitted to observe you, find out who your friends are, what you do and say with them, what you buy, and where you go? Do social media and personalized search restrict our intellectual horizons? Do we live in polarizing information bubbles, just hearing echoes of what we already know and believe? As computing technology becomes ever more pervasive and sophisticated, we are presented with an escalating barrage of decisions about who, how, when, and for what purposes technology should be used. This course will provide an intellectual framework for discussing these pressing issues of our time, as we shape the technologies that in turn shape us. We will seek insight through reading, discussion, guest lectures, and debates. Students will also undertake an analysis of a relevant issue of their choice, developing their own position, and acquiring the research skills needed to lend depth to their thinking. The course will enhance students' ability to think clearly about contentious technology choices, formulate smart positions, and support their views with winning arguments.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>[IDeATe collaborative course] Learning is a complex human phenomenon with cognitive, social and personal dimensions that need to be accounted for in the design of technology enhanced learning experiences. In this studio course students will apply learning science concepts to critique existing forms of learning media, establish a set of design precedents to guide project work and produce a series of design concepts that support learning interactions in a real-world context. Collaborating in small interdisciplinary teams, students will partner with a local informal learning organization (e.g. museum, after school program provider, maker space) to conduct learning design research studies, synthesize findings, establish learning goals and iteratively prototype and assess design concepts. As final deliverables, students will present their design research findings, design concepts, and prototypes to stakeholders, and draft a media-rich proposal for their learning media concept to pitch to a local funder.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Recent advances in HCI have been driven by new capabilities to deliver inexpensive devices to users, to display information in mobile and other contexts, to sense the user and their environment, and use these sensors to create models of a user's context and actions.  This course will consider both concepts surrounding these new technological opportunities   through discussion of current literature - and practical considerations  the skills needed to actually build devices.    About 1/3 of this class will review current advances in this area.  The remainder will be devoted to development of individual skills so that students leaving the class will have an ability to actually build small devices for human interaction (in short: &quot;HCI gadgets&quot;). In particular, the course will concentrate on the basics of building simple microcontroller-based devices and will also provide very basic coverage of the machine learning techniques needed for simple sensor-driven statistical models.    The course is designed to be accessible to students with a wide range of backgrounds including both technically-oriented and non-technical students (especially Designers) interested in HCI. The class will be project oriented with 4-5 electronic prototype building projects during the semester. At least two of these projects will be self-defined in nature and can be adapted to the existing skills and interests of each student.    There are no formal prerequisites for this class. However, the class will involve programming and debugging of micro-controllers. Some coverage of the language used to do this will be provided, and if required by your background, the programming component of the projects can be made comparatively small (but, in that case some other aspect of the projects will need to be expanded). However, you should not take this course if you have no programming background. This course assumes no  background in electronics.<br/>

<dd>All Semesters: 9 units<br/>Most of management is communication. You communicate to get information that will be the basis of decisions, coordinate activity, to provide a vision for the people who work for and with you, to and to sell yourself and your work. The goal of this course is to identify communication challenges within work groups and organizations and ways to overcome them. To do this requires that we know how communication normally works, what parts are difficult, and how to fix it when it goes wrong. The focus of this course is on providing you with a broad understanding of the way communication operates within dyads, work groups, and organizations. The intent is to give you theoretical and empirical underpinnings for the communication you will undoubtedly participate in when you move to a work environment, and strategies for improving communication within your groups. Because technology is changing communication patterns and outcomes both in organizations and more broadly in society, the course examines these technological changes. Readings come primarily from the empirical research literature.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>The goal of this course is to examine cases where basic research on cognitive science, including cognitive neuroscience, has made its way into application, in order to understand how science gets applied more generally.  The course focuses on applications that are sufficiently advanced as to have made an impact outside of the research field per se; for example, as a product,  a change in practice, or a legal statute.  Examples are virtual reality (in vision, hearing, and touch), cognitive tutors, phonologically based reading programs, latent semantic analysis applications to writing assessment, and measures of consumers' implicit attitudes.     The course will use a case-study approach that considers a set of applications in detail, while building a general understanding of what it means to move research into the applied setting.  The questions to be considered include:  What makes a body of theoretically based research applicable?  What is the pathway from laboratory to practice?  What are the barriers - economic, legal, entrenched belief or practice?     The format will emphasize analysis and discussion by students.  They should bring to the course an interest in application; extensive prior experience in cognitive science is not necessary.  The course will include tutorials on basic topics in cognitive science such as perception, memory, and spatial cognition.  These should provide sufficient grounding to discuss the applications.<br/>

The course emphasizes current work  in applied domains such as automotive design, house construction, medical  human factors, and design of information devices.  The course also will  emphasize not only individual human factors (e.g., visual response,  anthropometry) but also the organizational arrangements that can amplify  or correct human factors problems.    Through reading, discussion, and projects, you will learn about human  perceptual, cognitive, and physical processes that affect how people  interact with, and use, technology and tools.  You will learn why we have  so many automobile accidents, voting irregularities, and injuries from  prescription medication. You will learn some tried and true solutions for  human factors problems, and some of the many problems in human factors that  remain. You will also have gained experience in research in this field.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>This course considers the basic and detailed concepts for building software to implement user interfaces (UIs). It considers factors of input, output, application interface, and related infrastructure as well as the typical patterns used to implement them. It considers how these aspects are organized and managed within a well-structured object oriented system. We will cover a variety of &quot;front-end&quot; programming contexts, including conventional graphical user interface (GUI) programming for mobile apps (phones, watches), web apps, and regular desktop applications, across a variety of frameworks. We will also cover programming for data-driven and conversational (AI) user interfaces. We will briefly touch on front-end programming for visualizations, games, 3D, and virtual and artificial reality (VR and AR), along with interactive UI tools such as prototypers and resource editors. The homeworks and project in this course will involve extensive object-oriented programming, likely in both Java and JavaScript, so this course is only appropriate for students with a strong programming background.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Online learning has become widespread (e.g., MOOCs, online and blended courses, and Khan Academy) and many claim it will revolutionize higher education and K-12. How can we make sure online learning is maximally effective? Learners differ along many dimensions and they change over time. Therefore, advanced learning technologies must adapt to learners to provide individualized learning experiences.  This course covers a number of proven personalization techniques used in advanced learning technologies. One of the techniques is the use of cognitive modeling to personalize practice of complex cognitive skills in intelligent tutoring systems. This approach, developed at CMU, may well be the most significant application of cognitive science in education and is commercially successful. We will also survey newer techniques, such as personalizing based on student meta-cognition, affect, and motivation. Finally, we will look at personalization approaches that are widely believed to be effective but have not proven to be so.  The course involves readings and discussion of different ways of personalizing instruction, with an emphasis on cognitive modeling approaches. Students will learn to use the Cognitive Tutor Authoring Tools (CTAT) to implement tutor prototypes that rely on computer-executable models of human problem solving to personalize instruction.  The course is meant for graduate or advanced undergraduate students in Human-Computer Interaction, Psychology, Computer Science, Design, or related fields, who are interested in educational applications. Students should either have some  programming skills or experience in the cognitive psychology of human problem solving, or experience with instructional design.<br/>

<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>Machine Learning is concerned with computer programs that enable the behavior of a computer to be learned from examples or experience rather than dictated through rules written by hand. It has practical value in many application areas of computer science such as on-line communities and digital libraries. This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces. The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work. This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems. In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.  05-834 is the HCII graduate section.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Good design is a continuous improvement process that combines scientific principles and data-driven methods to achieve desired outcomes. E-learning design is no exception. In this course, you will learn how to design innovative e-learning, that is, online interactions and technology that make learning more effective and efficient. You will practice instructional design using learning science theories and principles and learning engineering using data-driven methods to discover insights about how learners think. Instructional designers explain and use principles of learning and instruction such as proven ways to support learning-by-doing, like deliberate practice and self-explanation, and proven ways to support multimedia learning from text, visuals, and audio. They employ &quot;backward design&quot;: designing and aligning learning goals, the assessments that measure them, and the instruction that achieves them. But today's learning engineers do not simply design in sequence  and #8212; goals then assessments then instruction  and #8212; but are agile and iterative. They collect qualitative data, for example, by having an expert &quot;think aloud&quot; while performing one of their assessments and use the results to add or change goals. They collect and use quantitative data, for example, by mining learning data from online course interactions or by comparing alternative designs in an A/B experiment. By using data, learning engineers create innovative and effective designs unlike the results of others who rely on science and intuition alone. You will do so too in an end-to-end e-learning design project, where you develop an e-learning module of your choice, continuously improve it, and test it in an A/B experiment.<br/>

This class is meant to teach the practical side of machine learning for applications, such as mining newsgroup data or building adaptive user interfaces.  The emphasis will be on learning the process of applying machine learning effectively to a variety of problems rather than emphasizing an understanding of the theory behind what makes machine learning work.  This course does not assume any prior exposure to machine learning theory or practice. In the first 2/3 of the course, we will cover a wide range of learning algorithms that can be applied to a variety of problems.  In particular, we will cover topics such as decision trees, rule based classification, support vector machines, Bayesian networks, and clustering. In the final third of the class, we will go into more depth on one application area, namely the application of machine learning to problems involving text processing, such as information retrieval or text categorization.<br/>

Students will implement language technologies for their languages.  In the course of creating the languages, students will learn about the building blocks of human language such as phones, phonemes, morphemes, and morpho-syntactic constructions including their semantics and pragmatics.    Class instruction will focus specifically on variation among human languages so that the students can make conlangs that are not just naively English-like.   We will also touch on philosophical issues in philosophy of language and on real-world socio-political issues related to language policy.     Students will be required to use at least one of the following technologies:  language documentation tools that are used for field linguistics and corpus annotation, automatic speech recognition, speech synthesis, morphological analysis, parsing, or machine translation.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>This course uses Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing as vehicles to teach principles in designing software to avoid patents. After introducing students to the basics of patents, we investigate how to use students software skills to design around patents that is, create new technology that avoids a patent while maintaining some, or even all, of the performance and value of the patented technology.  Designing around a patent can be viewed as a puzzle that requires technical skill, understanding the business value of technology, knowledge of patents, and creativity. Students will also be able to help design patents that cannot be easily designed-around.  Not only does this add a valuable new dimension to the student's skill set, the course material is organized as a vehicle for refining knowledge of ML and NLP techniques. We will practice by designing around patents on well-known ML and NLP algorithms. Students study the basic algorithm, learn the patents that cover those algorithms, and then experiment with software modifications that avoid the patent while preserving as much of the algorithm's performance as possible. In essence, students will view the presence of particular patents as a design constraints, akin to designing for limited memory, bandwidth, or processor speed.

Basic knowledge of NNs, known currently in the popular literature as &quot;deep learning&quot;, familiarity with various formalisms, and knowledge of tools, is now an essential requirement for any researcher or developer in most AI and NLP fields. This course is a broad introduction to the field of neural networks and their &quot;deep&quot; learning formalisms. The course traces some of the development of neural network theory and design through time, leading quickly to a discussion of various network formalisms, including simple feedforward, convolutional, recurrent, and probabilistic formalisms, the rationale behind their development, and challenges behind learning such networks and various proposed solutions. We subsequently cover various extensions and models that enable their application to various tasks such as computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation and playing games. Instruction Unlike prior editions of 11-785, the instruction will primarily be through instructor lectures, and the occasional guest lecture. Evaluation Students will be evaluated based on weekly continuous-evaluation tests, and their performance in assignments and a final course project.

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this century's information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory prob and amp;stats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of &quot;Language and Statistics&quot; is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipf's distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.

<dd>All Semesters: 12 units<br/>Neural networks provide powerful new tools for modeling language, and have been used both to improve the state-of-the-art in a number of tasks and to tackle new problems that were not easy in the past. This class will start with a brief overview of neural networks, then spend the majority of the class demonstrating how to apply neural networks to natural language problems. Each section class will introduce a particular problem or phenomenon in natural language, describe why it is difficult to model, and demonstrate several models that were designed to tackle this problem. In the process of doing so, the class will cover different techniques that are useful in creating models, including handling variably sized and structured sentences, efficient handling of large data, semi-supervised and unsupervised learning, structured prediction, and multilingual modeling.  There are no official pre-requisites, but a natural language processing course such as <a href="/search/?P=11-411" title="11-411" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '11-411');">11-411</a>, 11-611, or <a href="/search/?P=11-711" title="11-711" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '11-711');">11-711</a>, or other experience with implementing natural language processing models is highly recommended.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>The goal of the course is to give the student basic knowledge from several fields that is necessary in order to pursue research in automatic speech processing. The course will begin with a study of the acoustic content of the speech signal. The students will use the spectrographic display to examine the signal and discover its variable properties. Phones in increasingly larger contexts will be studied with the goal of understanding coarticulation. Phonological rules will be studied as a contextual aid in understanding the spectrographic display. The spectrogram will then serve as a first introduction to the basic elements of prosody. Other displays will then be used to study the three parts of prosody: amplitude, duration, and pitch. Building on these three elements, the student will then examine how the three interact in careful and spontaneous speech.     Next, the students will explore perception. Topics covered will be:   physical aspects of perception, psychological aspects of perception, testing perception processes, practical applications of knowledge about perception.   The second part of this course will cover all aspects of speech synthesis.     Students need only have a basic knoweldge of speech and language processing. Some degree of programming and statistical modelling will be beneficial, but not required.    Taught every other year<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">11-755 Machine Learning for Signal Processing</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Signal Processing is the science that deals with extraction of information from signals of various kinds. This has two distinct aspects  and #8212; characterization and categorization. Traditionally, signal characterization has been performed with mathematically-driven transforms, while categorization and classification are achieved using statistical tools.     Machine learning aims to design algorithms that learn about the state of the world directly from data.     A increasingly popular trend has been to develop and apply machine learning techniques to both aspects of signal processing, often blurring the distinction between the two.     This course discusses the use of machine learning techniques to process signals. We cover a variety of topics, from data driven approaches for characterization of signals such as audio including speech, images and video, and machine learning methods for a variety of speech and image processing problems.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Language technologies (search, text mining, information retrieval, speech recognition, machine translation, question answering, biological sequence analysis...) are at the forefront of this century's information revolution.  In addition to their use of machine learning, these technologies rely centrally on classic statistical estimation techniques.   Yet most CS and engineering undergraduate programs do not prepare students in this area beyond an introductory prob and amp;stats course.  This course is designed to plug this hole.  The goal of &quot;Language and Statistics&quot; is to ground the data-driven techniques used in language technologies in sound statistical methodology.   We start by formulating various language technology problems in both an information theoretic framework (the source-channel paradigm) and a Bayesian framework (the Bayes classifier).  We then discuss the statistical properties of words, sentences, documents and whole languages, and the computational formalisms used to represent language.  These discussions naturally lead to specific concepts in statistical estimation.  Topics include: Zipf's distribution and type-token curves; point estimators, Maximum Likelihood estimation, bias and variance, sparseness, smoothing and clustering; interpolation, shrinkage, and backoff; entropy, cross entropy and mutual information;  decision tree models applied to language; latent variable models and the EM algorithm; hidden Markov models; exponential models and maximum entropy; semantic modeling and dimensionality reduction; probabilistic context-free grammars and syntactic language models.  The course is designed for LTI  and amp; SCS graduate students, but others are welcome.  CS UG upperclassmen who've taken it have done well, though they found it challenging.

<dt class="keepwithnext">11-776 Multimodal Affective Computing</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Humans are highly social creatures and have evolved complex mechanisms for signaling information about their thoughts, feelings, and intentions (both deliberately and reflexively). In turn, humans have also evolved complex mechanisms for receiving these signals and inferring the thoughts, feelings, and intentions of others. Proper understanding of human behavior, in all its nuance, requires careful consideration and integration of verbal, vocal, and visual information. These communication dynamics have long been studied in psychology and other social sciences. More recently, the field of multimodal affective computing has sought to enhance these studies using techniques from computer science and artificial intelligence. Common topics of study in this field include affective states, cognitive states, personality, psychopathology, social processes, and communication. As such, multimodal affective computing has broad applicability in both scientific and applied settings ranging from medicine and education to robotics and marketing.     The objectives of this course are:  (1)    To give an overview of the components of human behavior (verbal, vocal, and visual) and the computer science areas that measure them (NLP, speech processing, and computer vision)  (2)    To provide foundational knowledge of psychological constructs commonly studied in multimodal affective computing (e.g., emotion, personality, and psychopathology)  (3)    To provide practical instruction on using statistical tools to study research hypotheses  (4)    To provide information about computational predictive models that integrate multimodal information from the verbal, vocal, and visual modalities  (5)    To give students practical experience in the computational study of human behavior and psychological constructs through an in-depth course project<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Multimodal machine learning (MMML) is a vibrant multi-disciplinary research field which addresses some of the original goals of artificial intelligence by integrating and modeling multiple communicative modalities, including linguistic, acoustic and visual messages. With the initial research on audio-visual speech recognition and more recently with language vision projects such as image and video captioning, this research field brings some unique challenges for multimodal researchers given the heterogeneity of the data and the contingency often found between modalities.  The course will present the fundamental mathematical concepts in machine learning and deep learning relevant to the five main challenges in multimodal machine learning: (1) multimodal representation learning, (2) translation  and amp; mapping, (3) modality alignment, (4) multimodal fusion and (5) co-learning.  These include, but not limited to, multimodal auto-encoder, deep canonical correlation analysis, multi-kernel learning, attention models and multimodal recurrent neural networks. We will also review recent papers describing state-of-the-art probabilistic models and computational algorithms for MMML and discuss the current and upcoming challenges. The course will discuss many of the recent applications of MMML including multimodal affect recognition, image and video captioning and cross-modal multimedia retrieval.

<dt class="keepwithnext">10-405 Machine Learning with Large Datasets (Undergraduate)</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions. This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity. The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student. The project will be designed to compare the scalability of variant learning algorithms on datasets.

Structured prediction problems abound throughout application areas such as natural language processing, speech processing, computational biology, computer vision, healthcare, and many others. In this course, we will study modern approaches to structured prediction building on probabilistic graphical models, deep learning, and search. The course will focus on three key aspects: models, inference, and learning. The models we consider will focus on both generative and discriminative models such as Bayesian networks, Markov random fields (MRFs), conditional random fields (CRFs), and deep neural networks including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  and #8212; as well as hybrids of graphical models and neural networks. The course will explore approaches to exact and approximate inference: junction tree algorithm, approximate marginal inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational methods, approximate MAP inference by integer linear programming (ILP) and search. We will explore unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning using different formulations of the learning problem: MLE, Bayesian inference, structured perceptron, M3Ns, learning to search, and autoencoders.

This course explores the optimization algorithms used to solve these machine learning problems. We characterize the properties of the optimization problems that enable these techniques to be efficient (e.g. convexity, smoothness, linearity, separability) as well as properties that inhibit efficient optimization (e.g. nonconvexity). Core topics include first order methods (gradient descent, subgradient methods, proximal and stochastic gradient descent), duality and linear programming, and second-order/quasi-Newton methods. We also consider advanced techniques ranging from those that have spurred the growth of deep learning (e.g. adaptive gradient methods, momentum) and those that enable large-scale distributed optimization. The course will focus both on theory and practical applications, frequently drawing motivation from examples in machine learning. The course is designed so that a machine learning (ML) course could be taken after or before this one; ML is not a prerequisite. Students will gain the tools to both implement and analyze modern optimization techniques.<br/>Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=21-240" title="21-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-240');">21-240</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-241" title="21-241" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-241');">21-241</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-325" title="21-325" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-325');">21-325</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=36-219" title="36-219" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-219');">36-219</a> Min. grade C or 36-217 Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-359" title="15-359" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-359');">15-359</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-254" title="21-254" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-254');">21-254</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=11-485" title="11-485" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '11-485');">11-485</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-315" title="10-315" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-315');">10-315</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-301" title="10-301" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-301');">10-301</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-259" title="21-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-259');">21-259</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=15-151" title="15-151" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-151');">15-151</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-127" title="21-127" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-127');">21-127</a> Min. grade C) and <a href="/search/?P=15-122" title="15-122" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-122');">15-122</a> Min. grade C<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">10-605 Machine Learning with Large Datasets</dt>
<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>Large datasets are difficult to work with for several reasons. They are difficult to visualize, and it is difficult to understand what sort of errors and biases are present in them. They are computationally expensive to process, and often the cost of learning is hard to predict - for instance, and algorithm that runs quickly in a dataset that fits in memory may be exorbitantly expensive when the dataset is too large for memory. Large datasets may also display qualitatively different behavior in terms of which learning methods produce the most accurate predictions.  This course is intended to provide a student practical knowledge of, and experience with, the issues involving large datasets. Among the issues considered are: scalable learning techniques, such as streaming machine learning techniques; parallel infrastructures such as map-reduce; practical techniques for reducing the memory requirements for learning methods, such as feature hashing and Bloom filters; and techniques for analysis of programs in terms of memory, disk usage, and (for parallel methods) communication complexity.  The class will include programming assignments, and a one-month short project chosen by the student. The project will be designed to compare the scalability of variant learning algorithms on datasets.

But as personal devices that interact with us in natural language become ubiquitous (e.g., Siri, Google Now), they open an amazing possibility of letting users teach machines in natural language, similar to how we teach each other. Conversation, as an interface to machine learning systems, opens a new paradigm that both unifies several existing machine learning paradigms (e.g., active learning, supervised learning), but also brings a unique set of advantages and challenges that lie at the intersection of machine learning and natural language processing.

We will present you with several well-defined open problems and provide you with recently collected datasets that can get you started immediately!

In the past decade, researchers across many communities, from applied statistics to engineering, computer science and neuroscience, have developed deep models that are composed of several layers of nonlinear processing. An important property of these models is that they can learn useful representations by re-using and combining intermediate concepts, allowing these models to be successfully applied in a wide variety of domains, including visual object recognition, information retrieval, natural language processing, and speech perception.   The goal of this course is to introduce students to both the foundational ideas and the recent advances in deep learning. The first part of the course will focus on supervised learning, including neural networks, back-propagation algorithm, convolutional models, recurrent neural networks, and  their extensions with applications to image recognition, video analysis, and language modelling. The second part of the course will cover unsupervised learning, including variational autoencoders, sparse-coding, Boltzmann machines, and generative adversarial networks.

Structured prediction problems abound throughout application areas such as natural language processing, speech processing, computational biology, computer vision, healthcare, and many others. In this course, we will study modern approaches to structured prediction building on probabilistic graphical models, deep learning, and search. The course will focus on three key aspects: models, inference, and learning. The models we consider will focus on both generative and discriminative models such as Bayesian networks, Markov random fields (MRFs), conditional random fields (CRFs), and deep neural networks including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs)  and #8212; as well as hybrids of graphical models and neural networks. The course will explore approaches to exact and approximate inference: junction tree algorithm, approximate marginal inference by Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and variational methods, approximate MAP inference by integer linear programming (ILP) and search. We will explore unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning using different formulations of the learning problem: MLE, Bayesian inference, structured perceptron, M3Ns, learning to search, and autoencoders.

This course explores the techniques from machine learning and artificial intelligence that are driving the recent advances in generative modeling and foundation models. Students will understand, develop, and apply state-of-the-art algorithms that enable machines to generate realistic and creative content. Core topics will include: the fundamental mechanisms of learning; how to build generative models and other large foundation models (e.g. transformers for vision and language, diffusion models); how to train such models (pre-training, fine-tuning) and efficiently adapt them (adapters, in-context learning); how to scale up to massive datasets (multi-GPU/distributed optimization); how to employ existing models for everyday use (generating code, coding with a generative model in the loop). Students will also explore the theoretical foundations and empirical attempts to understand their inner workings as well as learn about the ways in which things can go wrong (bias, hallucination, adversarial attacks, data contamination) and ways to combat these problems. Students in the course will develop understanding of modern techniques through implementation, but they will also employ existing libraries and models to explore their generative capabilities and limitations. The course is designed for students who have completed an introductory course in machine learning or deep learning.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=10-301" title="10-301" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-301');">10-301</a> Min. grade C or 11-785 Min. grade C or 11-685 Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=11-485" title="11-485" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '11-485');">11-485</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-715" title="10-715" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-715');">10-715</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-701" title="10-701" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-701');">10-701</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-601" title="10-601" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-601');">10-601</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-315" title="10-315" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-315');">10-315</a> Min. grade C<br/>

<dt class="keepwithnext">10-625 Introduction to Convex Optimization</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br/>As machine learning grows in prominence, so also has optimization become a mainstay for machine learning, particularly techniques for convex optimization. Most learning problems are formulated as optimization of some objective function, sometimes subject to constraints. This course explores the optimization algorithms used to solve these machine learning problems. We characterize the properties of the optimization problems that enable these techniques to be efficient (e.g. convexity, smoothness, linearity, separability) as well as properties that inhibit efficient optimization (e.g. nonconvexity). Core topics include first order methods (gradient descent, subgradient methods, proximal and stochastic gradient descent), duality and linear programming, and second-order/quasi-Newton methods. We also consider advanced techniques ranging from those that have spurred the growth of deep learning (e.g. adaptive gradient methods, momentum) and those that enable large-scale distributed optimization. The course will focus both on theory and practical applications, frequently drawing motivation from examples in machine learning. The course is designed so that a machine learning (ML) course could be taken after or before this one; ML is not a prerequisite. Students will gain the tools to both implement and analyze modern optimization techniques.<br/>Prerequisites: (<a href="/search/?P=21-240" title="21-240" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-240');">21-240</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-241" title="21-241" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-241');">21-241</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=36-219" title="36-219" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '36-219');">36-219</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-325" title="21-325" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-325');">21-325</a> Min. grade C or 36-217 Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-359" title="15-359" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-359');">15-359</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=10-315" title="10-315" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-315');">10-315</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-259" title="21-259" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-259');">21-259</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=10-301" title="10-301" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-301');">10-301</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-256" title="21-256" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-256');">21-256</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=21-254" title="21-254" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-254');">21-254</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=11-485" title="11-485" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '11-485');">11-485</a> Min. grade C) and (<a href="/search/?P=21-127" title="21-127" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-127');">21-127</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-151" title="15-151" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-151');">15-151</a> Min. grade C) and <a href="/search/?P=15-122" title="15-122" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-122');">15-122</a> Min. grade C<br/>

<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>Machine learning studies the question: &quot;how can we build adaptive algorithms that automatically improve their performance (on a given task) as they acquire more experience?&quot; This can cover a dizzying array of technologies depending on what sort of task we have in mind, and we take to constitute experience. Through this framing, we might view classical statistics problems, like estimating the likelihood that a coin lands on heads as an ML problem: the task is to produce an estimate, and the experience would consist of observations. But ML can also include robotics challenges, where the experience is acquired dynamically as our artificial agent interacts with the real world. Other grand challenges in machine learning relate to personalized medicine, natural language processing, and most recently generating media artifacts like photographs and essays (but don't ask chatGPT to do your homework). This course is designed to give PhD students a solid foundation in the methods, mathematics, and algorithms of modern machine learning. Students entering the class with a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics and algorithms will be at an advantage, but the class has been designed so that anyone with a strong mathematical and computer science background can catch up and fully participate.

It treats both the ?art? of designing good learning algorithms and the ?science? of analyzing an algorithm?s statistical properties and performance guarantees. Theorems are presented together with practical aspects of methodology and intuition to help students develop tools for selecting appropriate methods and approaches to problems in their own research.  Though computation is certainly a critical component of what makes a method successful, it will not receive the same central focus as methodology and theory.   We will cover topics in statistical theory that are important for researchers in machine learning, including consistency, minimax estimation, and concentration of measure. We will also cover statistical topics that may not be covered in as much depth in other machine learning courses, such as nonparametric density estimation, nonparametric regression, and Bayesian estimation.<br/>Prerequisites: (10-705 or 36-705) and (<a href="/search/?P=10-701" title="10-701" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-701');">10-701</a> or <a href="/search/?P=10-715" title="10-715" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-715');">10-715</a>)<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Many of the problems in artificial intelligence, statistics, computer systems, computer vision, natural language processing, and computational biology, among many other fields, can be viewed as the search for a coherent global conclusion from local information. The probabilistic graphical models framework provides an unified view for this wide range of problems, enabling efficient inference, decision-making and learning in problems with a very large number of attributes and huge datasets. This graduate-level course will provide you with a strong foundation for both applying graphical models to complex problems and for addressing core research topics in graphical models.  The class will cover three aspects: The core representation, including Bayesian and Markov networks, and dynamic Bayesian networks; probabilistic inference algorithms, both exact and approximate; and, learning methods for both the parameters and the structure of graphical models. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of probability, statistics, and algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate.  It is expected that after taking this class, the students should have obtain sufficient working knowledge of multi-variate probabilistic modeling and inference for practical applications, should be able to formulate and solve a wide range of problems in their own domain using GM, and can advance into more specialized technical literature by themselves.

<dt class="keepwithnext">10-725 Convex Optimization</dt>
<dd>Intermittent: 12 units<br/>Nearly every problem in machine learning can be formulated as the optimization of some function, possibly under some set of constraints. This universal reduction may seem to suggest that such optimization tasks are intractable. Fortunately, many real world problems have special structure, such as convexity, smoothness, separability, etc., which allow us to formulate optimization problems that can often be solved efficiently. This course is designed to give a graduate-level student a thorough grounding in the formulation of optimization problems that exploit such structure, and in efficient solution methods for these problems. The main focus is on the formulation and solution of convex optimization problems, though we will discuss some recent advances in nonconvex optimization. These general concepts will also be illustrated through applications in machine learning and statistics. Students entering the class should have a pre-existing working knowledge of algorithms, though the class has been designed to allow students with a strong numerate background to catch up and fully participate. Though not required, having taken <a href="/search/?P=10-701" title="10-701" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '10-701');">10-701</a> or an equivalent machine learning or statistical modeling class is strongly encouraged, as we will use applications in machine learning and statistics to demonstrate the concepts we cover in class.

<dd>Intermittent<br/>Artificial intelligence (AI) systems now generate authentic paintings, compose music pieces, and find out-of-box solutions to real-life problems in our world. Creativity, which was considered to be a moon shot for AI, does not seem to be too far any more. Is that true? Are we close to see creative AI? The answer is yes and no. We are moving closer with meaningful developments in Machine Learning, however there are several questions to be explored further to achieve the creative AI. What kind of creativity we want to represent? How do we translate creativity into what machines can understand? How do we design ML algorithms to be more creative?   This course is where we explore these questions through seminars and projects. Our goal is to design computational models that present the very possibility of the creative AI.   The instructors who are specialized in Machine Learning Art and Robotics lead this course together. We introduce related examples and possible methods including multi-modal data-driven learning, learning from demonstration, and combined learning from data and human demonstrations.

The course will start by providing a basic arsenal of useful statistical and computational tools, including generalization guarantees, core algorithmic methods, and fundamental analysis models.  We will examine questions such as: Under what conditions can we hope to meaningfully generalize from limited data?  How can we best combine different kinds of information such as labeled and unlabeled data, leverage multiple related learning tasks, or leverage multiple types of features?  What can we prove about methods for summarizing and making sense of massive datasets, especially under limited memory?  We will also examine other important constraints and resources in data science including privacy, communication, and taking advantage of limited interaction.  In addressing these and related questions we will make connections to statistics, algorithms, linear algebra, complexity theory, information theory, optimization, game theory, and empirical machine learning research.  Topics to be covered will include: - Fundamental measures of complexity for generalization, including   VC-dimension and Rademacher complexity. - Core algorithmic tools including boosting, regularization, and   online optimization with connections to game theory. - Spectral methods, streaming algorithms and other approaches for   handling massive data. - Foundations and algorithms for addressing important constraints or   externalities such as privacy, limited memory, and communication   constraints. - Foundations for modern learning paradigms including semi-supervised   learning, never-ending learning, interactive learning, and deep   learning.<br/>

<dd>Fall and Spring: 12 units<br/>In 1965 British mathematician I.J. Good wrote, An ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an intelligence explosion, and the intelligence of man would be left far behind.  As we enter an age where companies like Uber are testing driverless cars in Pittsburgh and innovative interfaces like IBMs Watson can play jeopardy and learn techniques for medical diagnoses, how are we to negotiate an intelligence explosion that for many individuals might threaten the very notions of what it means to be human?  The future of human-to-machine relationships will likely define our historical epoch and yet, many young technologists and humanists underestimate the downstream impact of technological innovations on human society.  Presently, we have little choice but to attend to this rapidly anxiety-ridden question.  This seminar will attend to the challenge of present existential questions on what it means to be human (read not machine) in the context of a rapidly advancing technological age.  We will consider human narratives throughout history that exam how governments and individual citizens defined humanity in the context of slavery and colonialism as a framework for exploring and projecting what it means to be human in the age of rapidly advancing intelligent machines.  We will trace the technological advancements of the recent five decades and identify historical precedents and speculative narratives that help us to consider issues like labor, economic disparity, negotiations of power, human dignity and ethical responsibility within the context of human relations with advancing technological tools that are now coined, artificial intelligence.<br/>

We investigate the ways in which visual art to literature to theatrical performance explores and interrogates societal conflict and emergence from conflict, and how evolving technological systems influence political power dynamics and modes of artistic practice.   We will use the legacy of societal conflict in Ireland and Northern Ireland to compare concepts and physical manifestations of borders, barriers and bridges in the region and in global contexts. We will examine fluctuating development of democratic processes in Ireland and Northern Ireland, individual and group public performance, and the influence of technologically crude and highly sophisticated tools on communities emerging from strife. We will use our analytical lens to focus on figurative and literal borders, barriers and bridges to explore work produced in Belfast, Derry and Dublin, alongside circumstances and artistic practice in present-day Pittsburgh, Cuidad Juarez, Jerusalem and Soweto.   On a visit to Ireland and Northern Ireland over spring break, students will meet with artists, writers, legislators, community organizers, academics and ex-combatants, to learn about their past experience and current motivations.

<dt class="keepwithnext">16-730 Robotics Business</dt>
<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course introduces and develops business concepts that will be useful to new and existing companies, while focusing on robotic technology exemplars.  The concepts begin with how to identify a new idea to for a business that can be effectively started.  Initial ideas often start as a grandiose plan to change the world and these plans are legitimately the fuel that drive new businesses forward.  However, when a company starts (e.g., builds a prototype or writes a  first line of code), what is the least product a company can produce that customers still want and need?  This kernel  and #8212; extracted from the &quot;big plan&quot; and #8212; is a Minimal Viable Product (MVP).   Once an MVP business kernel is formulated, we will learn and study how to understand customer needs, how to market a new idea and how raise and manage money for a new business entity.  These steps abridge information that can be found in an MBA curriculum, but engineers and scientists focused on the technical side will need this information to participate in the process of building companies.  In parallel, we will investigate the marketplace through the stock market.  The stock market is a powerful window into the world of business.  In other words, when a new business is built it has to live inside the competitive environment of every other business.  To understand this eco-system, we will follow several companies in-situ as they go through their own ups-and-downs within the business world.  The course is project based.  Each student will either build their own business concept,  or they will build an improvement plan that would be targeted to improve an existing business.  Professor Bourne is a founding member of the Robotics Institute(1979) and has taught business concepts within the Tepper Business School and the Robotics Institute since 1988.  In addition, he is the President of his own company Design One Software.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>People and animals move through and interact with the world in a fundamentally dynamic way. In the vast majority of cases the same cannot be said for robots. In fact, many conventional approaches to motion planning and robot control attempt to explicitly cancel out the dynamics associated with different tasks. This class will consider underactuated robots, systems that do not have full control over their state and therefore cannot be planned for or controlled via conventional methods. Our goal will be to make novel locomoting robots act more &quot;naturally.&quot; This class will highlight the relationship between conventional ideas from deterministic motion planning and control design (e.g., dynamic programming and linear-quadratic regulators) and their contemporary counterparts, many of which help form the analytical basis for the probabilisitic reasoning that underlies contemporary AI systems (e.g., POMDPs). Note that this course is inspired by and, for the most part, will follow the format of &quot;Underactuated Robotics: Learning, Planning, and Control for Efficient and Agile Machines&quot; created by Prof. Russ Tedrake at MIT.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>Safe autonomy has become increasingly critical in many application domains. It is important to ensure not only the safety of the ego robot, but also the safety of other agents (humans or robots) that directly interact with the autonomy. For example, robots should be safe to human workers in human-robot collaborative assembly; autonomous vehicles should be safe to other road participants. For complex autonomous systems with many degrees of freedom, safe operation depends on the correct functioning of all system components, i.e., accurate perception, optimal decision making, and safe control. This course deals with both the design and the verification of safe robotic systems. From the design perspective, we will talk about how to assure safety through planning, prediction, learning, and control. From the verification perspective, we will talk about verification of deep neural networks, safety or reachability analysis for closed loop systems, and analysis of multi-agent systems.<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>**Previously Course number 17213** Have you wondered how Linux and the subsequent development of open-source software ecosystems could thrive despite weak economic incentives? Why do large-scale complex software systems sometimes fail despite well-developed guardrails and practices? What makes a recommendation system on social media so effective and so toxic at the same time? Why do YouTube mega-influencers with tens of millions of subscribers exist, yet each of us only recognize a handful of them at best? Why do echo chambers form and polarization deepen in social media platforms despite the utopian promise of frictionless connectivity that these platforms initially envisioned? How can you land your dream jobs? How does mass adoption of technological innovations happen (e.g., Python, Bitcoin)? Underlying these seemingly unrelated questions is the powerful influence of social networks, the collection of on- and offline social connections, communications, and collaborations that people form with one another. This course offers an introduction to the study of social networks as a powerful tool for formalizing these wide range of questions, for understanding social dynamics in various settings, and for solving real-world problems arising at the intersection of human social behavior and technological systems. The course first introduces network science concepts and their mathematical operationalization's that give rigorous definitions to fuzzy words we use to describe the social world, such as &quot;status&quot; and &quot;social group&quot;. Students will subsequently learn how these network concepts were used to analyze and solve a wide range of puzzling online social phenomena. Finally, the course will introduce statistical models of networks that enable principled investigation of network formation mechanisms.<br/>

This time involves deployment - the period between the completion of the code by the developers and the placing of the code into normal production  and dealing with operations issues. Deployment time can be days, weeks, or even months when using normal development practices. Operational issues such as dealing with incidents and errors introduce other delays. Modern internet companies deploy a system multiple or even dozens of times every day. Achieving this velocity requires coordinated process and design activities together with supporting tooling. This course will cover the deployment process and the associated tooling, it will highlight reasons why release schedules can be slow, and it will introduce the practices that are used to enable high velocity deployments. It will also cover the kinds of problems that are created because of high velocity and how modern internet companies deal with these problems.

<dd>Spring: 9 units<br/>In recent decades, developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have rapidly moved from research environments to products and services used by billions of people.  This rapid rate of change has often resulted in a public which does not understand the technologies shaping their lives and lawmakers who are poorly equipped to make sound policy.  It is therefore incumbent upon specialists to communicate how ICTs work to the public and lawmakers so policy making is shaped by evidence and reflects public desires.  This course will train students to be effective communicators and advocates in the ICT space.  Students taking this course will learn about the broader scope of technology policymaking including formal lawmaking, agency rule-making, strategic litigation, and corporate social responsibility.  Current ICT policy topics in privacy, free expression, net neutrality, and competition will be covered.  Public communication strategies such as writing op-eds, interviewing with journalists, producing explanatory videos and interactive games will be explored.  Finally, students will learn how to perform an expert role in areas such as writing policy briefs and providing testimony. The course is open to advanced undergraduate and graduate students.  Graduate students whose research has public policy implications are encouraged to develop projects related to their research.  There is no requirement for programming knowledge, but students with experience in developing interactive media and games will be encouraged to utilize such skills.  The class will focus heavily on readings, critical evaluation of real ICT advocacy campaigns, and homework will provide hands-on experience with numerous strategies for public engagement.

While they are already very useful devices, we have only started to scratch the surface here. The aim of this class will be to introduce the students to building and understanding smart sensing devices. The course will include discussion into contribution of various fields, including human-computer interaction, embedded computing, computer vision, distributed systems, machine learning, signal processing, security, and privacy. We will discuss how these various disciplines are coming together to form an end-to-end system that generates useful and user-actionable data. We will take a hands-on approach towards building and evaluating these systems. The students will gain practical experience in developing sensing systems in different application domains, such as activity recognition, health sensing, gestural interaction, etc. You will learn about embedded systems and understand the advantages and limitations of different platforms. You will learn about sensors and how to interface them with the real world to be able to get useful and actionable data. You will learn how to build a network of sensors that can communicate with each other. You will also learn about storing the sensor data for visualization, analysis and presentation both locally and to the cloud. The course will be a combination of lectures, tutorials, class discussions, and demonstrations. Students will be evaluated based on 5 mini-projects/assignments, class participation, weekly reading summaries, and a final project. All hardware resources will be provided to the students and they will be given an option to take their final prototypes with them for the cost of the hardware components.

<dt class="keepwithnext">17-663 Programming Language Pragmatics</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>This course provides a broad and pragmatic foundation in the most basic tool of the programmer: programming languages.  It starts with the fundamentals of syntax, parsing, and binding, the core structural concepts in programming languages.  The course will then cover program semantics and type systems, and students will learn to relate them with a type soundness theorem.  Finally, a coverage of intermediate optimization and code generation offers the opportunity to discuss both producing efficient code and reasoning about the correctness of program transformations.  Assignments involve a combination of tool-assisted formal reasoning and proofs about programming languages, and implementing these language constructs in a compiler.  This course fulfills the Logic  and amp; Languages constrained elective of the B.S. in Computer Science.  Students with substantial math and programming experience who have not satisfied the specific prerequisites can contact the instructor for permission to enroll.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-251" title="15-251" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-251');">15-251</a> Min. grade C and (<a href="/search/?P=21-228" title="21-228" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '21-228');">21-228</a> Min. grade C or <a href="/search/?P=15-150" title="15-150" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-150');">15-150</a> Min. grade C)<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Traditional compiler and programming language courses focus on language implementations that generate code statically (offline) for a target machine. Yet in today's landscape, many programming languages run on virtual machines where either a virtual instruction set architecture (bytecode) or the source code of the program is translated (and optimized) dynamically for an underlying machine. Such languages come with additional challenges beyond traditional compilation as taught in courses, including efficient representation of high-level language constructs and automatic memory management in the form of garbage collection. Together, the components of the virtual machine and services form what is known as a managed runtime system.  This course focuses on implementation techniques for managed runtime systems. Students will learn the basics of virtual machine implementation and build working prototypes to run actual programs. Prior knowledge of compilers and some familiarity with programming language implementation is required.<br/>Prerequisites: <a href="/search/?P=15-411" title="15-411" class="bubblelink code" onclick="return showCourse(this, '15-411');">15-411</a> or 15-611<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>This advanced course studies the nature of software bugs and security vulnerabilities arising in complex application domains and surveys specialized program analysis + automated testing techniques for identifying such issues proactively. The course will take a tour of various domains such as mobile systems, databases, web browsers, distributed and networked systems, autonomous vehicles, and smart contracts. For each domain, the class will review case studies of high-impact software bugs that have manifested in production and will then discuss state-of-the-art research techniques that aim to uncover such bugs automatically. Apart from the literature review, students will engage significantly with software system design and engineering via hands-on assignments and a semester-long project involving real-world applications and analysis tools for one or more domains. Students completing this course will be able to (a) identify practical challenges of applying well-known program analysis and testing techniques to complex application domains, (b) formulate and leverage domain-specific assumptions for making analysis techniques tractable in a specialized setting, and (c) build practical tools for improving software quality in large-scale systems.  The course assumes that students have some background in reasoning about software quality, system security, and/or working with program representations. The course builds upon mathematical principles introduced in foundational classes on program analysis, verification, or compiler design, as well as system design principles encountered in introductory security or software engineering courses.

<dt class="keepwithnext">17-731 Foundations of Privacy</dt>
<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>Privacy is a significant concern in modern society. Individuals share personal information with many different organizations - healthcare, financial and educational institutions, the census bureau, Web services providers and online social networks - often in electronic form. Privacy violations occur when such personal information is inappropriately collected, shared or used. We will study privacy in a few settings where rigorous definitions and enforcement mechanisms are being developed - statistical disclosure limitation (as may be used by the census bureau in releasing statistics), semantics and logical specification of privacy policies that constrain information flow and use (e.g., by privacy regulations such as the HIPAA Privacy Rule and the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act), principled audit and accountability mechanisms for enforcing privacy policies, anonymous communication protocols - and other settings in which privacy concerns have prompted much research, such as in social networks, location privacy and Web privacy (in particular, online tracking  and amp; targeted advertising).<br/>

<dd>Fall: 12 units<br/>NOTE: Previously offered as 08-733. This course focuses on policy issues related to privacy from the perspectives of governments, organizations, and individuals. We will begin with a historical and philosophical study of privacy and then explore recent public policy issues. We will examine the privacy protections provided by laws and regulations, as well as the way technology can be used to protect privacy. We will emphasize technology-related privacy concerns and mitigation, for example: social networks, smartphones, behavioral advertising (and tools to prevent targeted advertising and tracking), anonymous communication systems, big data, and drones.  This is part of a series of courses offered as part of the MSIT-Privacy Engineering masters program. These courses may be taken in any order or simultaneously. Foundations of Privacy (Fall semester) offers more in-depth coverage of technologies and algorithms used to reason about and protect privacy. Engineering Privacy in Software (Spring semester) focuses on the methods and tools needed to design systems for privacy.  This course is intended primarily for graduate students and advanced undergraduate students with some technical background.

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>This course surveys how digital trace data of human activity online, combined with careful research design and data analytics, have led to surprising discoveries and development of novel theoretical explanations in the field of computational social science (CSS). The course has three aims. (a) It is intended to stimulate new ways of formulating research questions on pressing/emerging societal issues of interest (e.g., political polarization, gender representation in open-source software development, decentralized governance based on blockchain technology) given the possibilities afforded by a wide array of digital trace data (e.g., social media, open-source software collaboration, cryptocurrency transactions, satellite imagery). This course will (b) discuss exemplary works in CSS that made novel discoveries or made theoretical and/or methodological breakthroughs and (c) cover practical considerations that commonly arise in a CSS research project cycle. These issues may include, but are not limited to, data collection (sampling methods and bias), repurposing existing datasets that were collected in a different research context, constructing metrics based on theoretical insights, analytic approaches adequate for a given research question (statistical modeling, network analysis, online experiments, simulation-based theory development), big data processing and analytic tools (distributed data processing frameworks, visualization), ethical considerations, and data sharing. In the end, this course will help participants develop &quot;good taste&quot; for theoretically insightful, methodologically creative, and well thought out research, while learning to identify potential pitfalls that could arise in their own research.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>How likely is an intervention like social distancing to save lives?  Will a law legislating sanctions against social media platforms that spread disinformation stop the spread?  We live and work in complex adaptive and evolving socio-technical systems where questions such as these arise constantly. Questions such as these are often only addressable through computational modeling, i.e., through simulation.  Simulation models are a critical method for understanding how to adaptation and learning will change the status-quo. Computational modeling can be used to help analyze, reason about, predict the behavior of, and possibly control complex human systems of &quot;networked&quot; agents.  Using simulation it is possible to advance theory, test policies before enacting them, and think through non-linear social effects.<br/>

<dd>Spring: 12 units<br/>We study the following question in this course: How do we perform useful analysis on a data set that contains sensitive information about individuals without compromising the privacy of those individuals?  To study this question, we will introduce differential privacy, a framework of designing data analysis algorithms with strong, meaningful, and mathematically provable privacy guarantees. We will survey a set of algorithmic tools that allow us to privately perform a wide range of statistical analyses. Of course, privacy does not come for free, and we will also study some of the fundamental limitations imposed by the requirement of differential privacy. Through the discussion of these results, we will also demonstrate some of the most novel and surprising connections between differential privacy and other areas of theoretical computer science, including machine learning theory, cryptography, convex geometry, and game theory.<br/>
