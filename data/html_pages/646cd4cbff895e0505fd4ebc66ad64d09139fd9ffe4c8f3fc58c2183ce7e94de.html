Health care in the United States can be very expensive. A single doctor’s office visit may cost several hundred dollars and an average three-day hospital stay can cost tens of thousands of dollars (or even more) depending on the type of care provided. Most of us could not afford to pay such large sums when we get sick, especially since we don’t know when we might become ill or injured or how much care we might need. Health insurance offers a way to reduce such costs to more reasonable, affordable amounts. The way it typically works is that the consumer (you) pays an up front premium to a health insurance company and that payment allows you to share ‘risk’ with lots of other people (enrollees) who are making similar payments. Since most people are healthy most of the time, the premium dollars paid to the insurance company can be used to cover the expenses of the (relatively) small number of enrollees who get sick or are injured."><span class="su-multi-menu__link-text-wrapper">General Information About Health Insurance</span></a><ul class="su-multi-menu__menu su-multi-menu__menu-lv4"><li class="su-multi-menu__item"><a class="su-multi-menu__link" href="/insurance-referral-office/important-information-2024-2025-cardinal-care/general-information-about#how"><span class="su-multi-menu__link-text-wrapper">How Health Insurance Works in the United States</span></a></li><li class="su-multi-menu__item"><a class="su-multi-menu__link" href="/insurance-referral-office/health-insurance-overview-and-cardinal-care/general-information-about#insurance" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Learn about Out-of-Pocket Expenses, Annual Deductible, Copayment (or ‘Copay’), Coinsurance, Annual Out-of-Pocket Maximum and What It Means to Be a ‘Covered Benefit.&#039;"><span class="su-multi-menu__link-text-wrapper">Important Insurance Terms and Concepts</span></a></li></ul></li><li class="su-multi-menu__item su-multi-menu__item--parent"><a class="su-multi-menu__link" href="/insurance-referral-office/important-information-2024-2025-cardinal-care/cardinal-care-student" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Cardinal Care Overview*
