<p>Join us for 'Disinformation &amp; Democracy' an informative demonstration and discussion about disinformation and it's influence in our democracy and elections organized by the IDeaS center. The event will feature informative&#160;presentations from faculty and student researchers about their disinformation research at CMU. Attendees will be able to engage in Q&amp;A with presenters and have the opportunity to see demonstrations of software tools used for identifying and countering online harms including disinformation. Program information and agenda is below. Demonstrations will take place before and after panels for in-person participants to explore. Panels will be livestreamed during the event but Q&amp;A will not be available for those attending virtually. Please use the link below to register for virtual participation. No registration is needed for in-person participants.</p>

                <p><strong>AESOP (Demonstration by Matthew Hicks)</strong><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>We often conduct games or exercises for the information environment ,&#160;</span><span>such as a game for seeing whether people can recognize that someone is&#160;</span><span>trying to influence their opinions.&#160; Such games or exercises employ a&#160;</span><span>scenario which specifies what people are talking about what kind of&#160;</span><span>messages are being sent, by whom, and so on.&#160; AESOP is a scenario&#160;</span><span>generation tool that uses large language models to help the game or&#160;</span><span>exercise designer develop a scenario, and that generates all persona&#160;</span><span>(actors and their characteristics), news stories, press releases, and&#160;</span><span>guidelines for social media.&#160; In this demo you will see AESOP in&#160;</span><span>action and be able to try it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>ORA &amp; BEND (Demonstrated by Rebecca Marigliano)</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<span>ORA is a network analysis and visualization engine that can be usedfor any kind of data that can be represented as nodes and relations.One of the key features of ORA is that it enables rapid analysis ofsocial media data such as X, Reddit, Telegram and Facebook.&#160; BEND is aframework for assessing who is influencing whom in what way and towhat effect.&#160; Within ORA you can assess messages to see whether theauthors of those posts are trying to influence someone, in what way,and whether it is effective.&#160; In this demo you will be able to see ORAin operation and the BEND framework.&#160;<em>A class on network analytics including there use for social media</em><em>analytics will be taught by Dr. Carley in Spring 2025 and you can sign</em><em>up for it - undergraduates or masters 17-685&#160; , PhD students - <a href="//www.cmu.edu/casos-center/events/courses/index.html">17-801</a>.</em><br/></span><br/>
<ul>
<li><strong>NetMapper (Demonstrated by Dawn Robertson)</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>NetMapper uses computational linguistics to assess sentiment, emotions, moral values and other factors expressed in text. It can also convert long texts such as news articles or court records to networks, extract phone numbers, and addresses.&#160; NetMapper is important in helping understand how people respond to misinformation and in characterizing misinformation stories.&#160; In this demo you will</div>
<div>see NetMapper in action and be able to type in texts for it to process.</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bot Tools (Demonstrated by Lynnette Ng)</strong><br/><span></span></li>
</ul>
<div><span>Bots are completely automated systems that in social media can act as&#160;</span><span>agents communicating content and/or interacting with others.&#160; It is&#160;</span><span>estimated that at least 30% of all messages in many social media&#160;</span><span>platforms are from bots.&#160; Bots are often used to send disinformation.&#160;</span><span>In this demo bot detectors are demonstrated.&#160; There are also bot&#160;</span><span>labelers that type bots.</span></div>

<p><span>Uttara&#8217;s research lies at the intersection of technology, business, and policy. Her research focuses on technology&#8217;s impact on society. Her work is largely interdisciplinary: she combines economic and experimental methods with AI to study digital platforms and consumer behavior. She leverages large-scale data and novel AI methods to analyze the data to identify patterns in consumer behavior.&#160; Her research informs managerial practice to build and sustain consumer trust in digital products while balancing the realities of revenue and user engagement. She is especially interested in the design of inclusive and socially responsible digital products and platform policies and, in her research, evaluates how they can transform consumer behavior, both online and offline.</span></p>

Kathleen M. Carley's research combines cognitive science, network science, computer science and social science to address complex organizational, social and cultural problems. Her specific research areas include dynamic network analysis, computational social and organization theory, network adaptation and evolution, social cybersecurity, and online behavior during times of upheaval (e.g., disasters and elections). She and her students have developed infrastructure tools for analyzing large scale dynamic networks, social media and various multi-agent simulation systems.</p>

                <p><strong>AESOP (Demonstration by Matthew Hicks)</strong><br/><span></span></p>
<p><span>We often conduct games or exercises for the information environment ,&#160;</span><span>such as a game for seeing whether people can recognize that someone is&#160;</span><span>trying to influence their opinions.&#160; Such games or exercises employ a&#160;</span><span>scenario which specifies what people are talking about what kind of&#160;</span><span>messages are being sent, by whom, and so on.&#160; AESOP is a scenario&#160;</span><span>generation tool that uses large language models to help the game or&#160;</span><span>exercise designer develop a scenario, and that generates all persona&#160;</span><span>(actors and their characteristics), news stories, press releases, and&#160;</span><span>guidelines for social media.&#160; In this demo you will see AESOP in&#160;</span><span>action and be able to try it.</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span><strong>ORA &amp; BEND (Demonstrated by Rebecca Marigliano)</strong></span></li>
</ul>
<p><span>ORA is a network analysis and visualization engine that can be usedfor any kind of data that can be represented as nodes and relations.One of the key features of ORA is that it enables rapid analysis ofsocial media data such as X, Reddit, Telegram and Facebook.&#160; BEND is aframework for assessing who is influencing whom in what way and towhat effect.&#160; Within ORA you can assess messages to see whether theauthors of those posts are trying to influence someone, in what way,and whether it is effective.&#160; In this demo you will be able to see ORAin operation and the BEND framework.&#160;<em>A class on network analytics including there use for social media</em><em>analytics will be taught by Dr. Carley in Spring 2025 and you can sign</em><em>up for it - undergraduates or masters 17-685&#160; , PhD students - <a href="//www.cmu.edu/casos-center/events/courses/index.html">17-801</a>.</em><br/></span></p>

<li><strong>NetMapper (Demonstrated by Dawn Robertson)</strong></li>
</ul>
<div>NetMapper uses computational linguistics to assess sentiment, emotions, moral values and other factors expressed in text. It can also convert long texts such as news articles or court records to networks, extract phone numbers, and addresses.&#160; NetMapper is important in helping understand how people respond to misinformation and in characterizing misinformation stories.&#160; In this demo you will</div>
<div>see NetMapper in action and be able to type in texts for it to process.</div>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bot Tools (Demonstrated by Lynnette Ng)</strong><br/><span></span></li>
</ul>
<div><span>Bots are completely automated systems that in social media can act as&#160;</span><span>agents communicating content and/or interacting with others.&#160; It is&#160;</span><span>estimated that at least 30% of all messages in many social media&#160;</span><span>platforms are from bots.&#160; Bots are often used to send disinformation.&#160;</span><span>In this demo bot detectors are demonstrated.&#160; There are also bot&#160;</span><span>labelers that type bots.</span></div>
