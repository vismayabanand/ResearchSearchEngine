            Quantum Computing (QC) offers the potential to solve
            certain types of problems for human kind; problems that
            are today, prohibitive for traditional computing. It could
            lead to exciting breakthroughs in areas such as improved
            efficiency in logistics chains, increased battery
            performance for cars or helping to find new pharmaceutical
            treatments. But what is hype and what is realistic given
            the development of the field in recent years and its
            current trajectory? What role do scientists, engineers,
            managers, entrepreneurs, policy makers and other
            stakeholders play? This course provides multiple
            viewpoints including academic, industry and
            governmental. You will hear from leading MIT faculty and
            pioneering practitioners in the field. We will demystify

            Comprehensively presents the breadth of considerations
            needed to apply data science and data-driven AI techniques
            successfully. Students will learn the landscape of
            challenges, a unique rubric for systematically evaluating
            them, and then see the rubric’s application to a variety
            of case studies. Through a combination of readings
            including the 2022 book, (Data Science in Context,
            Foundations, Challenges, and Opportunities), lectures, and
            in-class discussions, students will delve deeply into
            seven sets of implementation- and requirements-oriented
            challenges: from data gathering to meeting ethical, legal,
            and societal needs. Students will present in class and
            write a short (5-10 pages but carefully crafted) paper
            individually or in groups of two undertaking a careful
            analysis of a complex application of data science/ML,
            aiming at post-class publication on a web-site.  The
            instructor will advise the students on their projects
            during small, custom-scheduled recitation sections.  This
            class will provide students with additional skills needed
            to perform/lead successful data science/ML efforts (as
            data scientists, engineers, or product managers), and it
            will provide a better understanding of future
            opportunities in research, business, and public policy.

            and form the backbone of industry-scale systems like
            AlphaFold 3, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion. Topics include
            mathematical aspects of diffusion-based models (including
            forward and inverse diffusion processes, Fokker-Planck
            equations, computational and statistical complexity
            aspects of score estimation), the use of diffusion models

            Our goal is to address the broad problem of designing a
            general-purpose intelligent robot. To address this
            question, a very broad background is required. We propose
            to spend the first 4 weeks covering important background
            topics: each week will combine a foundational tutorial
            reading with one or two state-of-the-art research
            results. In the subsequent weeks, we will address topics
            that cut across the basic disciplinary boundaries,
            typically combining two or more areas, with the work
            focused on studying and discussing current research in the
            relevant area.

            algorithmic parts in two exemplary imaging systems. The
            third round involves a class project on an imaging system
            chosen by students. Undergraduate and graduate versions
            share lectures but have different recitations. Involves
            optional "clinics" to even out background knowledge of
            linear algebra, optimization, and computational
            imaging-related programming best practices for students of
            diverse disciplinary backgrounds. Students taking graduate
            version complete additional assignments.

            From a single picture, humans reconstruct a mental
            representation of the underlying 3D scene that is
            incredibly rich in information such as shape, appearance,
            physical properties, purpose, how things would feel,
            smell, sound, etc. These mental representations allow us
            to understand, navigate, and interact with our environment
            in our everyday lives. We learn this from little
            supervision, mainly by interacting with our world and
            observing the world around us.

            Emerging neural scene representations aim to build models
            that replicate this behavior: Trained in a self-supervised
            manner, the goal is to reconstruct rich representations of
            3D scenes that can then be used in downstream tasks such
            as computer vision, robotics, and graphics.

            This course covers fundamental and advanced techniques in
            this field at the intersection of computer vision,
            computer graphics, and deep learning. It will lay the
            foundations of how cameras see the world, how we can
            represent 3D scenes for artificial intelligence, how we
            can learn to reconstruct these representations from only a
            single image, how we can guarantee certain kinds of
            generalization, and how we can train these models in a

            for life sciences and their ethical implications. The
            class will cover common pitfalls in data preparation and

            in presence of bias, privacy-preserving data access, and
            methods for uncertainty estimation. We will also discuss

            Contemporary understanding of imaging is essentially
            computational: it involves encoding onto a form of
            radiation the information about a physical object,
            transferring the radiation through the imaging system,
            converting it to a digital signal, and finally
            computationally decoding the object information and
            presenting it to the user. This class introduces a unified

            rounds of the spiral, the instructors describe the

            systems. The third round the students conduct themselves
            in the context of the class project on an imaging system
            of their choice. The undergraduate and graduate versions
            share lectures but have different recitations. Throughout

            A time series is a time-stamped set of noisy observations
            from an underlying process that evolves over time. These
            observations are dependent on each other in a particular,
            unknown, fashion. Examples of such series include stock
            values, value of a currency with respect to the dollar,
            mean housing prices, the number of Covid-19 infections, or
            the pitch angle of an airplane during flights. Modeling
            such processes for the purpose of prediction or
            intervention is a fundamental problem in statistical
            learning. This is a research-oriented graduate-level
            course that will address three lines of development:

            Learning Structured Models: In this part of the course, we
            focus on learning the underlying stochastic dynamic model
            that generates the data. We discuss how algorithms depend
            on the underlying class of models adopted for this
            learning. We address the accuracy and reliability of our
            learned models particularly if the model class does not
            contain a ‘true’ model. We extend these ideas to dynamic
            systems with flexible input design.

            Prediction: In this part of the course, we make no
            assumptions on how the data is generated and we focus on
            predicting the next outcome of the process based on past
            observations. In this context, we analyze Matrix and
            Tensor Completion Methods in providing such predictions
            and we analyze the accuracy of these prediction in the
            presence of noise, missing data, and finally with
            interventions.

            Optimal Intervention and RL: A key ingredient of RL is a
            simulator that can estimate the value of a reward for a
            given intervention. In this part of the course, we build
            on techniques from Reinforcement Learning as well as the
            first two parts to show how new intervention/control can
            be derived with better outcomes. The course will consist
            of three guided projects, corresponding to each of the
            units above, as well as a final project selected by the
            students.

	    From a single picture, humans reconstruct a mental
	    representation of the underlying 3D scene that is
	    incredibly rich in information such as shape, appearance,
	    physical properties, purpose, how things would feel,
	    smell, sound, etc. These mental representations allow us
	    to understand, navigate, and interact with our environment
	    in our everyday lives. We learn this from little
	    supervision, mainly by interacting with our world and
	    observing the world around us.

	    Emerging neural scene representations aim to build models
	    that replicate this behavior: Trained in a self-supervised
	    manner, the goal is to reconstruct rich representations of
	    3D scenes that can then be used in downstream tasks such
	    as computer vision, robotics, and graphics.

	    This course covers fundamental and advanced techniques in
	    this field at the intersection of computer vision,
	    computer graphics, and deep learning. It will lay the
	    foundations of how cameras see the world, how we can
	    represent 3D scenes for artificial intelligence, how we
	    can learn to reconstruct these representations from only a
	    single image, how we can guarantee certain kinds of
	    generalization, and how we can train these models in a
	    self-supervised way.

This course explores a variety of problems, mostly within graph algorithms, and discusses how they can be solved faster using a fast matrix multiplication algorithm. We will also see that although many of these problems provably require the use of matrix multiplication to be solved exactly, sometimes matrix multiplication can be avoided by computing answers approximately, leading to very fast algorithms. Finally, we will discuss most of the known algorithms for matrix multiplication including the Coppersmith-Winograd algorithm and its relatives.

This problem has been studied from many perspectives; this course will approach the problem using algorithmic methods from theoretical computer science. Specifically the course will rely on synchronous, stochastic Spiking Neural Network (SNN) models. It will identify abstract problems to be solved by SNNs, including problems of focus and attention, similarity and clustering, representation, and learning. It will study algorithms  (networks) that solve the problems, and analyze them in terms of costs such as network size and convergence time.  Major emphasis will be on how concepts (both logical and physical) are represented in the brain, how these representations satisfy algorithmic goals, and how they are learned. Other emphasis will be on understanding how noise and uncertainty affect the costs of solving problems, and on how networks that solve simple problems can be combined into larger networks that solve more complex problems.</div>

Modeling, sensing and control fundamentals for possible next generation SCADA in support of highly distributed operations and design are introduced. Most of the concepts will be illustrated using homegrown Scalable Electric Power System Simulator (SEPSS). </div>

	  </div>
	  <div class="sdesc"> An overview of the theory of parameterized algorithms and the emergent "problem-centric" theory of fine-grained complexity, both of which reconsider how to measure the difficulty and feasibility of solving computational problems. Topics include: fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and its characterizations, the W-hierarchy (W[1], W[2], W[P], etc), 3SUM-hardness, APSP-equivalences, SETH hardness of problems, as well as connections to circuit complexity and other aspects of computing. Extended description follows: This course consists of two parts, both of which are intensively active research areas in theoretical computer science. The first part deals with problem parameterizations. Many problems we want to solve are often NP-hard or worse, but they need to be solved anyway. Over the years, multiple paradigms for coping with NP-hardness have been introduced by either relaxing the problem or strengthening the computational model. Within the last 20 years, a new paradigm arose where one measures the time complexity of an algorithm not just in terms of the but also a small side . A priori, the parameter can be anything, but the interesting case is when complex instances of the problem still have relatively small parameter values. The goal is to identify interesting parameterizations of hard problems where we can design algorithms running in time polynomial in the input length but possibly exponential (or worse) in the small parameter. Such an algorithm is called "fixed-parameter tractable". The first part of the course will develop techniques for designing efficient fixed-parameter algorithms, and for showing that for various problems such algorithms are unlikely to exist. The second part of the course focuses not on "hard" problems but rather problems that have already been deemed "easy", i.e. those that are known to have polynomial time algorithms and thus for which NP-hardness says nothing. The best known algorithms for many easy problems have high runtimes and are rarely used in practice. Improving these running times has been a longstanding open problem, with little to no progress. It is thus completely plausible that these algorithms are optimal. However, developing unconditional lower bounds seems nearly impossible with current techniques. A new, conditional theory of hardness has recently been developed, based around several plausible conjectures. The theory develops  interesting reductions between seemingly very different problems, showing that the reason why the known algorithms have been difficult to improve is likely the same, even though the known runtimes of the problems of interest might be very different. The second part of the course will deal with this “fine-grained complexity” theory. We will see many reductions, and also connections to classical circuit complexity theory. The course will be heavily research-oriented with lots of open problems, and it will introduce you to new ways of thinking about existing theory. </div>

	  <div class="sdesc"> This is a "big think" course about the future of technology and society.  It has the unifying theme of the tradeoff between cooperation and competition. The course covers a variety of topics in computer science, biology, psychology, philosophy, mathematics, economics, political science, and more. We present our thesis that technological advancements like artificial intelligence and personal manufacturing will shift the tradeoff, increasing the value of cooperation and reducing the value of competition. That will provide an unprecedented opportunity to redesign our social structures in a more cooperative and sustainable way. We provide concrete proposals for how this might be done for the central institutions of the economy, government, justice, and education. We welcome alternative proposals, as well as critiques and disagreements.  We see this course as a "design workshop" for a future society.</div>

It  is meant to be a synthesizing experience for advanced students in  computer science: a way for them to see the field as a whole, not  through a survey, but by reliving the experience of its creation,  relating the original work to the field as it exists today. The aim is  to create a unified view of the field by replaying its entire  evolution at an accelerated rate, giving students the opportunity to become sophisticated generalists. Learning occurs mainly through reading and discussion. For a typical class day, students will read two papers (possibly in excerpted form)  and prepare a short diary entry summarizing points they wish to  remember, discuss, or clarify. Class meetings begin with brief remarks from the instructor, followed by structured small group discussions, with students taking turns leading and documenting the discussions,  ending with a full class discussion. We expect that no student will be familiar in advance with all the material, but every student will know some of it, so that by the end of the term everyone will have learned  from everyone else. Some of the authors may visit the class to discuss the circumstances surrounding their early work. Assessment is based on class participation and a final video project in which students will argue for the importance of a paper that was not included in the readings.

	    will involve critiques of existing project-based learning

	    will involve working with middle-school students in

In particular, a novel unified modeling in energy/power dynamical space  is  introduced  to  conceptualize dynamics of interactions of complex multi-physicals components. No specialized knowledge of physical components is required.  This modeling sets a basis for  analysis, computation, sensing, control, power electronics, optimization and market design concepts. The course  prepares students for working on applying many novel methods and technologies, ranging from computer methods,  power electronics control,  for designing and operating more reliable, secure, and efficient electric energy systems. Students interested in both applied physics and signals and systems should consider taking this subject. Once the fundamentals of today's power systems are understood, it becomes possible to consider the role of smart electric power grids and power electronics-control  in enabling evolution of future electric energy systems. Integration of intermittent energy resources into the existing grid by deploying distributed sensors and actuators at the key locations throughout the system (network, energy sources, consumers) and changes in today's Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) for better performance become well-posed problems of modeling, sensing and controlling complex dynamic systems. This opens opportunities to many innovations toward advanced sensing and actuation for enabling better physical performance. Modeling, sensing and control fundamentals for possible next generation SCADA in support of highly distributed operations and design are introduced. Most of the concepts will be illustrated using homegrown Scalable Electric Power System Simulator (SEPSS).</div>

	  <div class="sdesc"> Today’s ML solutions can achieve impressive—sometimes super-human—performance that suggests that a broad deployment of ML will revolutionize almost every aspect of our lives. However, much of its development so far has been focused on clean and controlled/simulated settings and has had an average-case/“proof of concept” perspective in mind. And this mindset, despite being very useful up until now, turns out to be grossly inadequate for the—often high-stakes—nature of real-world deployment of ML. Here, the chief design goal is robustness to the variety of corruptions that abound in real-world contexts, whether benign or malicious in nature. It is also necessary to have a fine-grained grasp of the biases learned by our models and the impact of employing them in decision making. Finally, to be truly useful, our ML tools need to be understandable to humans and easy to work with even for users with no ML expertise. The current ML toolkit tends to fail catastrophically with respect to the above criteria. As such, we need a new, multi-pronged effort that will revisit all the tenets of the existing ML framework and build the next generation of machine learning that can be deployed in the real world in a safe, secure and responsible manner. This course will begin with background lectures, and then shift into a series of lectures (given by co-instructors) about fundamental ideas and phenomena that are relevant to building a truly deployable ML. Class projects will then require the students to explore these topics in more depth and present them in a form of a presentation and report.</div>

The proposed course is an advanced undergraduate course designed to study the fundamental sensing, computing, and communication software technologies at the core of the recent flurry of activity on IoT. In addition to exposure to fundamental technologies (power management, positioning, ranging, wireless radios, inertial sensors, etc), students will learn how to design and implement (1) libraries and applications on mobile devices that interact with internal and external sensors, (2) server-side modules for computation and storage, and (3) embedded software. Key topics covered in the class include positioning technologies (GPS, WiFi and cellular localization), wireless networks (including BLE, WiFi, Zigbee, multi-hop and delay-tolerant networks), resource constraints (including power, bandwidth, and storage), inertial sensing (accelerometers, gyroscopes, IMUs, dead-reckoning), other types of sensors (e.g., microphones and cameras), application studies (e.g., shooter localization, object recognition, acoustic habitat monitoring), embedded hardware and software architecture, and mobile APIs to sensors. The course includes hands-on labs to develop software on iOS to acquire, process, and analyze sensor data, and open-ended term projects in which the students have developed and prototyped many creative ideas.

	  </div>
	  <div class="sdesc"> An overview of the theory of parameterized algorithms and the emergent "problem-centric" theory of fine-grained complexity, both of which reconsider how to measure the difficulty and feasibility of solving computational problems. Topics include: fixed-parameter tractability (FPT) and its characterizations, the W-hierarchy (W[1], W[2], W[P], etc), 3SUM-hardness, APSP-equivalences, SETH hardness of problems, as well as connections to circuit complexity and other aspects of computing. Extended description follows: This course consists of two parts, both of which are intensively active research areas in theoretical computer science. The first part deals with problem parameterizations. Many problems we want to solve are often NP-hard or worse, but they need to be solved anyway. Over the years, multiple paradigms for coping with NP-hardness have been introduced by either relaxing the problem or strengthening the computational model. Within the last 20 years, a new paradigm arose where one measures the time complexity of an algorithm not just in terms of the but also a small side . A priori, the parameter can be anything, but the interesting case is when complex instances of the problem still have relatively small parameter values. The goal is to identify interesting parameterizations of hard problems where we can design algorithms running in time polynomial in the input length but possibly exponential (or worse) in the small parameter. Such an algorithm is called "fixed-parameter tractable". The first part of the course will develop techniques for designing efficient fixed-parameter algorithms, and for showing that for various problems such algorithms are unlikely to exist. The second part of the course focuses not on "hard" problems but rather problems that have already been deemed "easy", i.e. those that are known to have polynomial time algorithms and thus for which NP-hardness says nothing. The best known algorithms for many easy problems have high runtimes and are rarely used in practice. Improving these running times has been a longstanding open problem, with little to no progress. It is thus completely plausible that these algorithms are optimal. However, developing unconditional lower bounds seems nearly impossible with current techniques. A new, conditional theory of hardness has recently been developed, based around several plausible conjectures. The theory develops  interesting reductions between seemingly very different problems, showing that the reason why the known algorithms have been difficult to improve is likely the same, even though the known runtimes of the problems of interest might be very different. The second part of the course will deal with this “fine-grained complexity” theory. We will see many reductions, and also connections to classical circuit complexity theory. The course will be heavily research-oriented with lots of open problems, and it will introduce you to new ways of thinking about existing theory.</div>

While the final details for this extra section are not yet determined, each week you will be required to read a research paper selected to elaborate on the material presented in 6.034 for that week and write a one-page review of that paper to be handed in (on printed paper, not by email!) at the start of the Friday meeting.  With that preparation we will have a discussion of the material of the week elaborated by the paper you have read and commented on. Your weekly review should not be longer than one page.  Your review should be readable by someone who has not read the paper that is being reviewed.  The ability to write such a review is an important skill for you to develop.  It is not helpful to include a pile of mathematical formulas or lots of code in your review.  What I want is for you to learn to extract the essential take-away message of the paper: 1. What is the author trying to accomplish? 2. What technical methods is the author bringing to bear? 3. How successful was the resulting work? 4. Is there some lesson for us in the paper? If you need graduate credit, you can drop 6.034 and sign up for 6.S966 (12 units) on registration day.  If you are unsure about whether you want to take 6.S966, you can decide later.  Either way, attend the first session, this Friday, 8 September.  I will say more about what will be involved and answer questions.</div>

	  <div class="sdesc"> Interactive Music Systems is a hands on programming and design course that explores audio synthesis, musical structure, HCI (human computer interfaces), and visual presentation as the ingredients for the creation of engaging real-time interactive musical experiences. Interactive musical experiences beckon users to dynamically connect to music in ways not generally available through passive listening. The most successful ones provide palpable control, musical insight, heightened sensation, and an emotional response for the user. Some examples include: • Games like Guitar Hero, , and (pictured above) • Performance rigs like . • for the iPhone • , released in 1997 - Harmonixs first interactive music product. Students will learn about the principles, design considerations, and aesthetic qualities of interactive music systems by exploring the following topics: • Music perception and audio synthesis • Dynamic multi-track audio mixing and looping • Programmatic MIDI and event sequencing • Generative composition systems including rhythmic, melodic, and chord-progression synthesis • Exploration of non-standard control devices such as joysticks, spatial sensors (Kinect), and motion sensors (Playstation Move / WiiMote) • Analysis and application of design elements in music games • Building graphics for UI, music visualization, and aesthetic cohesion. The course is taught using python (python proficiency is required). Weekly assignments consist of programming exercises and content creation that equally emphasize the development of technical skills and creativity. The class requires a final project where students propose, design, and build an original, dynamic, and engaging interactive music system. Eran Egozy is Co-Founder and CTO of Harmonix Music Systems, most famously known for the games Guitar Hero, Rock Band, and Dance Central. Eran graduated from MIT with an M.Eng. in EECS and also plays clarinet.</div>
