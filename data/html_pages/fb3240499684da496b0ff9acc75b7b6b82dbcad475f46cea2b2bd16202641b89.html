                <b>Modules</b>: All the course content has been broken up into short <a href="modules/index.html">modules</a>,
                which include slides, recorded videos, and notes.

                <b>Lectures:</b> Instructors go over the main <a href="modules/index.html">modules</a> more slowly and interactively.
                All lectures will be recorded and available on Canvas.

                <b>Homework parties</b>: CAs help students work through homework problems in small groups.

                <b>Office Hours:</b> Meet 1:1 with instructors and CAs.
                There are two types of CA office hours: homework OH (for help with homework questions) and
                general OH (to ask questions about course content from lecture).
              </li>

            Please read <a href="https://communitystandards.stanford.edu/policies-guidance/honor-code">Stanford's honor
                code policy</a>.
            In the context of CS221,
            you are free to form study groups and discuss homeworks and projects.
            However, you must write up homeworks and code from scratch independently, and you must acknowledge in your
            submission all the students you discussed with.
            The following are considered to be honor code violations:
            <ul>
                <li>Looking at the writeup or code of another student.</li>
                <li>Showing your writeup or code to another student.</li>
                <li>Discussing homework problems in such detail that your solution (writeup or code) is almost identical
                    to
                    another student's solution.</li>
                <li>Uploading your writeup or code to a public repository (e.g., GitHub) so that it can be
                    accessed by other students.</li>
                <li>Looking at solutions from previous years, either official or written up by another student, or found
                    online.</li>
            </ul>
            When debugging code together, you are only allowed to look at the input-output behavior
            of each other's programs (so you should write good test cases!).
            We periodically run similarity-detection software over all
            submitted student programs, including programs from past quarters and any
            solutions found online on public websites.
            <p>
                <em>Generative AI Policy:</em> Each student is expected to submit their own solutions to the CS221 homeworks.
                You may use generative AI tools such as Co-Pilot and ChatGPT as you would use a human collaborator. This means that you may <i>not</i> directly ask
                generative AI tools for answers or copy solutions, and you must acknowledge generative AI tools as collaborators. 
                Additionally, you may not use generative AI tools to "check" your work, even if you wrote it yourself, as this is equivalent to having another student look at your answers.
                The use of generative AI tools to substantially complete an assignment or exam (e.g. by directly copying) is prohibited and will result in honor code violations.
                We will be checking students' homework to enforce this policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyone violating the honor code policy will be referred to the Office of Community Standards.
                If you think you violated the policy (it can happen, especially under time pressure!),
                please reach out to us; the consequences will be much less severe than if we approach you.

        <div class="section"><b>What is this course about?</b>
            The goal of artificial intelligence (AI) is to tackle complex real-world problems with rigorous mathematical
            tools.
            In this course, you will learn the foundational principles and practice implementing various AI systems.
            Specific topics include machine learning, search, Markov decision processes, game playing, constraint
            satisfaction, graphical models, and logic.
        </div>

        <div class="section"><b>Prerequisites:</b>
            This course is fast-paced and covers a lot of ground,
            so it is important that you have a solid foundation in a number of areas.
            Here are the basic skills that you need and the classes that teach those skills:
            <ul>
                <li><b>(Required)</b> Programming <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106a/">CS 106A</a>, <a
                    href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs106b/">CS 106B</a></li>
                <li><b>(Required)</b> Discrete math, mathematical rigor: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs103/">CS 103</a></li>
                <li><b>(Required)</b> Probability: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs109/">CS 109</a></li>
                <li><b>(Required)</b> Linear algebra: <a href="https://web.stanford.edu/class/math51/textbook.html">Math 51</a></li>
                <li>(recommended, but not required) Algorithms: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs161/">CS 161</a></li>
                <li>(recommended, but not required) Systems: <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs107/">CS 107</a> </li>
            </ul>
            It is less important that you know particular things (e.g., we
            don't use eigenvectors in this course even though that's a pillar
            of any linear algebra course),
            and more important that you've done enough related things that you
            feel at ease with it. While it is possible to fill in the gaps,
            this course does move quickly, and ideally you want to be focusing
            your energy on learning AI rather than catching up on
            prerequisites.
            We have made a few <a href="modules/index.html" target="_blank">prerequisite modules</a> that you can review
            to refresh your memory,
            and the first homework (foundations) will allow you to also get some practice on these basics.
        </div>

        <div class="section"><b>Further reading:</b>
            There are no required textbooks for this class, and you should be able to learn everything from the
            lecture notes and homeworks. However, if you would like to pursue more advanced topics or get another
            perspective on the same material, here are some great resources:
