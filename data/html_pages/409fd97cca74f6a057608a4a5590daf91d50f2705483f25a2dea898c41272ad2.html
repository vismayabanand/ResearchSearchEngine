<p><span><strong>John Choi</strong><span><br/>BCSA, Computer Science and Art<br/><br/></span><span>Filmmaking and robotics are inherently multidisciplinary endeavors. Producing a film requires the efforts of writers, artists and producers alike. Building a robot requires the collaboration of electrical, mechanical and software engineers. What happens when the two worlds get mashed together?&#160;We get advanced humanoid robot movie actors starring in a series of short films parodying famous movies along the likes of <em>Harry Botter</em>, <em>Saving Private Robot</em>, and <em>Fortran Gump</em>. With&#160;</span><em>Robot Parody Movies</em><span>, the line between artist and engineer becomes so blurred that there is literally no distinction between producing creative art and building creative invention.</span></span></p>
<p><span><span><strong>Luca Damasco</strong><span><br/>BCSA, Computer Science and Art<br/></span><strong>Zachary Rispoli</strong><span><span><br/>BFA, Art</span>&#160; <br/><br/><em><a href="http://wickeditor.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Wick">Wick</a></em>&#160;</span><span>is a free browser-based toolkit for creating interactive things for the internet. With&#160;</span><em>Wick</em><span>, you can create games, animations, and everything in between. Your creations can run on any device with a web browser&#8212;that means mobile too. And since <em>Wick</em> lives in the browser, you don't have to download any extra software to use it!</span></span></span></p>
<p><strong>Kabir Mantha</strong><br/><span>BSA, Mathematical Sciences and Music Technology&#160;with a minor in Sound Design&#160;</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p>A May 2017 production of <em>B&#233;la Bart&#243;k&#8217;s&#160;Bluebeard&#8217;s Castle</em>&#160;aims to radically reenvision a traditional opera to gain new perspectives on the work itself as well as the archetype of an operatic experience. This production transforms the music of Bart&#243;k with the immateriality of acousmatic performance to create an immersive electroacoustic experience. To achieve this, we subvert the traditional opera house listening paradigm by using a combination of live and prerecorded instrumental parts spatialized using a multichannel surround sound system in an intimate black box theater.</p>
<p><strong>Kira Melville</strong><span><br/>BFA, Art&#160;with a minor in Environmental Studies&#160;<br/><br/><em>Movin&#8217; with Kira</em></span><span>&#160;is a mobile, human-powered, dj protest float, a feminist chitty-chitty-bang-bang for political and social engagement.</span></p>
<h4><span>2016 AWARD WINNERS</span></h4>
<p><strong>Audrey Banks</strong><br/><span>BFA, Art</span></p>
<p><em>The Sentient Street</em>&#160;is a public art installation and performance in which a hundred objects in a public space are inhabited by individual personas that interact with the general public. By layering a fantastical anthropomorphized world of sentient objects over mundane environments, this project privileges emotional complexity over algorithmically-designed efficiency and invites the public to question our technophilic attraction to coldly intelligent environments and objects.</p>
<p><strong>Jacqueline Barnes</strong><span><br/>BHA, Creative Writing and Art</span><span><br/><br/></span><em>PhantaNoir</em><span>&#160;is producing three things: the beginning of a graphic novel, an explainatory article, as well as a short animation introducing the world of the graphic novel.&#160;</span><em>PhantaNoir</em><span>&#160;delves into the population of black fantasy fans, and calls not only for their representation, but for their dominance in a genre that has long ignored, debased or derided its black fan base. It was inspired not only by the need for representation, but for those within creative social circles who created and made black art so unapologetically.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>John Choi</strong><span><br/>BCSA, Computer Science and Art<br/><br/></span><span>As it stands today, access to human-size mobile manipulator robots is mostly limited to well-funded technical research institutions, often manned exclusively by a handful of engineers and scientists who find it difficult to imagine their robots being used outside of their labs in the name of art. In contrast, the objective of the&#160;</span><a href="https://johnchoi313.weebly.com/multipurpose-mobile-manipulator-mki.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Multipurpose Mobile Manipulator</em></a><span>&#160;is to build a series of research-grade mobile manipulator platforms that anyone can use and work with.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Madalyn Gryger</strong><span><br/>BHA, Psychology and Art<br/><br/><em>Sanctum</em>,</span><span>&#160;the&#160;</span><a href="http://lunargala.org/#polymorphism-popup" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Luna Gala</a><span>&#160;clothing line, explores the experience of living with mental illness.&#160;</span><span>Sanctum</span><span>&#160;is a place to feel safe. It explores the idea of safety in relation to mental illness by recreating boundaries in which people with mental illnesses live in the form of fashion. By using different materials, forms and transparencies, the line creates variations of boundaries between the model and the audience, thus mimicking the mental boundaries that living with a mental illness can create.</span></p>
<p><strong>Alicia Iott</strong><br/><span>BCSA, Computer Science and Art<br/></span><strong>Charlotte Stiles<br/></strong><span>BFA, Art<br/></span></p>
<p><em>The Girls are Home</em>&#160;takes the shiny new toy, virtual reality, and combines it with a traditional age-old toy, the dollhouse. Inside the dollhouse, an observer can peer through pairs of windows to see a universe created with VR. The dollhouse will have multiple pairs of windows so several viewers may observe different parts of the narrative simultaneously, thus each observer can create their own narrative. This project addresses the chasm that exists between cutting edge technology, material culture and the domestic, plain-Jane realm. By uniting a feminine childhood toy with a relevant and intriguing narrative about domestic characters using virtual reality,&#160;<span><em>The Girls are Home</em>&#160;</span>may bridge that gap.</p>
<p><strong>Ralph Kim&#160;</strong><span><br/>BFA, Art<br/></span><strong>Maryyann Landlord<br/></strong><span>BFA, Art<br/><br/></span><span>The interactive animation&#160;</span><em>Memory Slugs</em><span>&#160;utilizes multiple Oculus Rifts to deliver a novel storytelling structure, in which the virtual space reacts to the direction of the viewer's gaze. Whereas virtual reality typically entails isolation from immediate reality, this project facilitates social interaction by encouraging multiple participants viewing unique, emergent stories to verbally share their experiences, as well as provide a spectacle for viewers outside of the Rift.</span></p>
<p><span><strong>Lina Pulgarin-Duque</strong><span><br/>BSA, Physics and Drama<br/><br/></span><span></span><span><em>ChalkBot</em> is a CNC chalk plotting tool that aims to improve the way people interact with their cities and communities by promoting the adaptability of public spaces and establishing a sub-community through interaction with technology. Initially developed by Louis Elwood-Leach as a tool to aid event planning, the overlay of different software and hardware enables a wide variety of professional and amateur applications. <em>ChalkBot</em> is a new concept in digital manufacture and part of an exploration to discover how robots can become a part of our modern society. This iteration will be exploring how to use <em>ChalkBot</em> to create an interactive art experience.</span></span></p>
<p><strong>Lauren Valley</strong><span><br/>BFA, Art<br/><br/></span><em>Body Electric</em><span>&#160;is a sound reactive robotic dress that takes input in the form of pitch from the wearer and outputs it as motion through an eight-foot, motor-actuated skirt. The final performance will feature a vocalist wearing the dress while acting as the controller through the performance of an original composition.</span></p>
<h4><span><span>2015 Award Winners</span></span></h4>
<p><strong>Lindsay Cavallo</strong><br/><span>BFA, Art</span><br/><strong>Anna Failla</strong><br/><span>BHA, Ethics, History, &amp; Public Policy and Architecture</span><br/><strong>Samantha Riordan</strong><br/><span>BHA, Creative Writing and Architecture</span><span><br/></span></p>
<p><em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/DraculaandDracula" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Dracula &amp; Dracula</a></em>&#160;is a web series about the real life struggles of two everyday vampires and their monster friends. The series is a fully improvised vlog (vampire blog) starring two vampire friends who met at last year's monster convention. Each episode is fueled by relevant topics including facing monster prejudice, familial strife, the struggle to get a job in the current economy and debunking common misconceptions about vampires. This project will explore how the art of puppetry affects the way a story is perceived. The community of viewers is encouraged to interact and influence the content through online comments.</p>

Audience members will engage with the performance through their cell phones and be crucial in determining not only their own experience of the composition, but also the experience of those around them.&#160;</span><em>Isn&#8217;t it pretty to think so?</em><span>&#160;extends Stephen Sondheim&#8217;s principle, "Content Dictates Form," into the digital age to explore the way technology shapes our cultural landscape and how we experience it. The production will run on December 10, 2015 at 8:55pm in Chosky Theatre as part of the School of Drama's PLAYGROUND.</span></p>

The familiarity and appeal of trains is used as a metaphor to understand computational ideas. Trains must conform to established paths called tracks, much like how processors must conform to paths called programs. The fun game format aims to motivate players to open themselves up to experiencing algorithmic thinking and computer science in general. The components for&#160;</span><em>Hump Yard</em><span>, including track pieces and train cars, may be used by educators as effective manipulatives for teaching technical subject matter.</span></span></p>

<p><em>The Geromotion Machine</em>&#160;is a mobile web app station that can pull segments of audio from different sources and mix them to create sounds based on the movements of the users' bodies in front of a camera.&#160;<em>The Machine</em>&#160;draws the audience in by allowing them to pick and choose which audio sources to mix (input) to get an unexpected new sound (output) based on their movement. It encourages silly behavior and dancing in public places, as well as enabling the audience to let loose without worrying. Most of the inspiration for this project is from Henry&#8217;s ideas for a Frame show as well as his project&#160;<em>Audiyou and Me</em>.</p>

The physical realm includes didactic artwork aimed at informing the audience about the potential of everyday materials while the digital is a set of tools that act as catalysts in the zine-making process. The project was inspired by the fast and quick nature of millennial and hopes to provide them with a toolkit for zine-making.</span></p>

                <p><span>March 2, 1993 - December 7, 2012</span><br/><span><br/>In loving memory of a brilliant mind and a creative soul who will be sorely missed by all who knew and loved him.</span></p>
<p>Born in Madrid, Spain, Henry grew up in Spain, Mexico City and Greenwich, Connecticut. He graduated from Greenwich High School in 2011 where he was a member of the State Champion Math Team and was the co-founder of the Fictional World History Club. Henry received the Peter Church Memorial Award for Creativity in Math and Science.</p>
<p>Henry studied Computer Science and Art in the BCSA program at Carnegie Mellon University. He had interned at Nvidia Corporation in Silicon Valley and had accepted a position at Dropbox in San Francisco for Summer 2013. Henry&#8217;s academic talents and creative aesthetic pushed him to create works that brought people together. In the fall of 2012, Henry was the recipient of an arts grant to create a smartphone app which he called Audiyou and Me, with which groups of people would create music by wirelessly linking their smart phones to a central hub equipped with large speakers. Other projects Henry created included games, videos and installations; most memorably a two-person, 8-bit video game based on Shakespeare&#8217;s&#160;<span>The Winter&#8217;s Tale</span>, and a recreation of the Goya etching&#160;<span>The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters</span>&#160;as an animation on a whiteboard.&#160;&#160;</p>
<p>In addition to being a brilliant student whose teachers described his math proofs as works of art, Henry was an avid reader and supremely talented computer programmer, gamer, artist and musician. It was clear to all who knew him that his mind worked on a different level than anybody else's. Yet his joie de vivre and unique sense of humor allowed him to connect and be loved by everyone from 8 to 80.&#160;</p>
<p>The world has lost a larger than life character who promised so much and was loved and admired by all.</p>
