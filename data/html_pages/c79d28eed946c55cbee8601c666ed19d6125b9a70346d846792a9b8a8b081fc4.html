          <div>The <span class="bd">Michael Blaine Burks Scholarship</span> was established in the Computer
   Science Undergraduate Program at Carnegie Mellon, in honor of  a
   beloved alumni, Blaine Burks.  Recipients of the scholarship reflect
   the spirit of the award: that an academic career can be
   distinguished by unique attributes other than grades alone. These
   qualities include a drive to learn new ideas and concepts whatever
   the outcome,  a willingness to accept challenges, and perseverance
   in a field that is not the easiest "steer to wrangle" in the
   bullpen. The rewards of this approach can be great and always lead
   to an engaging and fulfilling life and career. </div>

My time at college is shorter that I'd like, so I strive to spend every moment meaningfully and toward an intrinsic goal, rather than following academic tradition for the sake of external rewards. I'm extremely grateful for the passionate community here that I can learn from and work with, and I sincerely appreciate the Blaine Burks Scholarship as recognition for my goals."</i></span></td>

        <div class="bio">
            <p> Blaine Burks was born in Texas City, Texas, on July 27, 1971. Three weeks later his family moved to Pittsburgh, PA, and this became Blaine's adopted home. The same year Blaine entered the first grade, his mother, Sharon, joined the staff in the Computer Science Department at Carnegie Mellon, and Blaine found his calling. From the first time he played "adventure", he knew that computer science was what he wanted to do. He became the "CS urchin", hanging around the main office, helping to pack tech reports and doing anything else he could find -- just to have the opportunity to sit at the "Silent 700" and play games for a while. </p>
            <p> Blaine spent most of his life in Bethel Park, PA. He attended the Logan Elementary School, Neil Armstrong Middle School, and graduated from Bethel Park High School in 1990. He had a life-long love of baseball, starting with T-ball at age 5, and enduring through high school, where he was a member of the varsity baseball team. </p>
            <p> Blaine had a natural musical talent, and loved music of all kinds. He played the drums, trumpet, guitar, and piano. During his teens he played in a local band which won the Bethel Park High School talent contest in 1989. He also occasionally played drums with the "Algorithmics", a group from Carnegie Mellon CSD that Blaine thought were the "coolest" guys around. </p>
            <p> During high school and early college years at Carnegie Mellon Blaine was employed part-time in the Computer Science Department, working with Scott Fahlman's group. Though I'm sure Scott often wondered why he was bothering, Blaine often told me that he learned more than he ever dreamt possible from Scott, not just about computing, but about fairness and honesty and dealing with people. </p>
            <p> In 1994 Blaine graduated from Carnegie Mellon and took a position with MAYA Design Group in Pittsburgh. In his four years with MAYA Blaine matured both professionally and personally. He learned how to be an entrepreneur, and that he wanted to run his own business. So he and his college friend packed up their belongings and headed for California.</p>
