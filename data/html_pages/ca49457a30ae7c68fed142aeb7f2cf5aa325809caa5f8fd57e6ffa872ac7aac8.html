Brief Bio / Statement of Credentials:
<p>
<p>

Amit Sahai is a Professor of Computer Science and (by courtesy) Mathematics at UCLA, and the incumbent of the Symantec Endowed Chair in Computer Science. He also serves as an Advisor to the <a href="https://www.prisonmathproject.org/">
Prison Mathematics Project</a>.
His primary research interests are in cryptography, coding theory, complexity theory, and security. 
He is the co-inventor of attribute-based encryption, functional encryption, and indistinguishability obfuscation. 
He was an invited lecturer at the 2022 International Congress of Mathematicians 
(ICM 2022, Special Sectional Lecture), 
and received the 2022 National Academy of Sciences Held Prize for his role in the development of indistinguishability obfuscation. 
His research works have been recognized by five Test of Time Awards 
(STOC 2024, FOCS 2023, Eurocrypt 2023, 
Eurocrypt 2020, ACM CCS 2016) and a STOC 2021 Best Paper Award.
For his teaching, he was given the 2016 Lockheed Martin Excellence in Teaching Award from the Samueli School of Engineering at UCLA. 
Many years ago, he was a member of the 1996 World Champion ACM ICPC Team from UC Berkeley.
He is also a Simons Investigator (2021), Fellow of the ACM (2018), 
Fellow of the IACR (2019), and Fellow of the AMS (2024).
